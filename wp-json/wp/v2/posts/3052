But the Internet evolves, and today SEM is generally considered to cover search engine advertising while SEO means organic methods to push search results ideally to the first page of search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s explore this in more detail.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Hallmarks of SEO<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>SEO endeavors to improve search engine results organically in a variety of ways. These include technical SEO, on-page SEO, content and backlinks.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Technical SEO<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You should both build and maintain your website with an eye toward SEO. Important search engine ranking factors in the structure and function of your site include<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How useable the site it on all devices including mobile devices<\/li>\n<li>Loading speed of your site\u2019s pages<\/li>\n<li>Website architecture and navigation that enable search engines to easily crawl your site and find data<\/li>\n<li>Error on your site such as broken links that affect crawlability<\/li>\n<li>Your site\u2019s indexing<\/li>\n<li>Your site\u2019s security<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Valuable Content<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to just throw any kind of content on your website and add some keywords. Google favors content that offers real value to the reader. Use your content such as blog posts to help support important pages on your website and push your audience to them.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>On-Page SEO<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>On-page SEO includes all the extra things you do every time you post content. That includes adding metadata such as title tags, meta descriptions to\u00a0 pages and images, and alt text to images that describes what is in the image. It also includes adding not only headings but also subheadings that are correctly indicated with header tags.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Backlinks<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If high authority domains link to your site, their credibility with search engines help to raise your site\u2019s credibility \u2013 and your site\u2019s search engine rankings. You can build backlinks in many ways. See <a href=\"https:\/\/www.umbrellaus.com\/recipe-for-good-backlinks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this article<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.umbrellaus.com\/get-quality-backlinks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this article.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Hallmarks of SEM<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Next in discussing the difference between SEO and SEM is to describe SEM in more detail. SEM is essentially paid digital advertising including PPC (pay per click) in order to get more eyeballs in search engine results. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.umbrellaus.com\/service\/white-label-google-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads<\/a> is one very effective way of doing this. You can buy ads that appear at the top of search engine results. These can be virtually any kind of Internet ads including text search engine ads, display ads, YouTube ads and more.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Benefits of SEO<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>With SEO you are playing the long game, and you are not going to see results overnight. It can take months before you see much in the way of SEO results. \u00a0But neither are you paying advertising costs with SEO. Your SEO efforts build on one another, and you see increasing returns over time.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Benefits of SEM<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you need to make a splash quickly such as when you are launching your company or a new product, you will want to supplement your SEO efforts with SEM. Paid advertising will give you much faster results than SEO.<\/p>\n<p>The downside of this is that when you stop advertising, you will immediately lose the search engine visibility that advertising gave you. As we have already pointed out, this is not true with SEO.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Use Both SEO and SEM<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>With very few exceptions, businesses should use both SEO and SEM in their marketing. Use SEM to get immediate clicks and conversions. Use SEO to build a lasting Internet presence over time.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Difference Between SEO and SEM Summarized<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Both SEO and SEM are going to help your website\u2019s visibility in search engines and drive traffic to your site. For each of these, you need to do keyword research and target your audience.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>SERP Appearance and Placement<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although SEM can get you at the top of search engines almost immediately, users are going to see that you have placed a paid ad, because it will be marked as such. That means that most users will not consider these results as credible as organic results. On the other hands, paid ads appear at the top above organic results.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Budget<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Every time someone clicks on your paid SEM ad, it\u2019s going to cost you if you are using a PPC model.<\/p>\n<p>If you gained search engine placement through organic SEO, on the other hand, it\u2019s not going to cost you a dime (beyond paying your SEO manager).<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Time<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>SEO is a slog. It takes months before you see results.<\/p>\n<p>SEM can produce immediate results<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Longevity<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Your cumulative SEO efforts keep on giving for quite awhile. If you hit a slow time and need to reduce or even stop your SEO efforts, you are not going to see an immediate decrease in your search engine visibility.<\/p>\n<p>But if you are running SEM campaigns and stop, all traffic and visibility from those campaigns end when you stop the campaign.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Not Sure About Your Mix of SEO and SEM?
