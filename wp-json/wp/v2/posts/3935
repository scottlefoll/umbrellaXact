One of the most effective ways to do that is to repurpose successful content and get it in front of new prospects. That\u2019s why in addition to running new ads on Facebook, Instagram and Instagram, you should regularly boost Facebook posts that have proven to be popular.<\/p>\n<p>You boost those posts you have been regularly publishing to your business\u2019s Facebook page in order to reach a wider audience. It costs you nothing for creative and very little time. Boosting Facebook boosts is an extremely effective way to reach new prospects at very little cost.<\/p>\n<p>But there are some ins and outs.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Does It Mean to Boost a Facebook Post?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you have a Facebook page for your business, hopefully you are regularly posting content to it that is of interest to your audience. Some may be about your products and services. And some may simply be educational content of interest to your customers. This will be seen by some but not all of your Facebook followers.<\/p>\n<p>All posts are not created equal, and you may want some to get bigger distribution than others. These could be just about anything from posts about new products and services to posts about awards your business has received. And sometimes when tracking your posts, your analytics tell you that one of them is getting an abnormally high number of clicks. These are examples of posts you may want to boost.<\/p>\n<p>When you boost a post, Facebook can show it to a wider audience with interests and demographics you specify, not just to your followers. You can also post beyond Facebook to Instagram and Messenger. It works very much like a typical paid ad, except you don\u2019t have to develop new creative. You can just boost what is already working in your organic posts. Like any advertising this can mean increased brand awareness, more engagement, more clicks, more leads and ultimately more sales.<\/p>\n<p>We are not saying to throw your Facebook ad campaign in the garbage. Targeted, specific Facebook ads are very effective. But there is no downside to giving your more successful or important organic posts a boost.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Steps to Boost Facebook Posts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Create a Facebook Page for Your Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You should already be publishing organic posts to your business\u2019s Facebook page. This is where you can publish posts of interest to your clients and that you want them to see. If you do not already have a Facebook page, find out how to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/104002523024878\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set up a Facebook page here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Post free organic posts here for awhile and use Facebook\u2019s analysis tools to track their success. Soon, you should have a good idea of what posts grab your audience\u2019s attention and may be good to boost.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Assign the Proper Page Role<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Not just anybody can go in and publish posts to your page and boost them. If you want someone in your organization or a freelancer to post, you must give them authority in the form of the proper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/289207354498410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">page role<\/a>. Page roles with authority to boost include admin, editor, moderator or advertiser. They will also need authority to pay for the boosts of course, the same as paying for advertising.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Select and Click<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After you select which post you want to boost, simple press the <em>Boost post<\/em> button at the bottom right of the post. It will look like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3929\" src=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/businessman-his-office-with-magnifying-glass-800.jpg\" alt=\"boost Facebook posts\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/businessman-his-office-with-magnifying-glass-800.jpg 800w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/businessman-his-office-with-magnifying-glass-800-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/businessman-his-office-with-magnifying-glass-800-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>4.
