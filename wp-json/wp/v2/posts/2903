But you will have to pay for many others, particularly a lot of industry-specific directories.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Major General Business Directories<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The major general business directories are usually more than just directories. These are a lot of them, and they include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bingplaces.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bing Places<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/business.yelp.com\/?promo&amp;utm_source=type%3Aclaim_ad_google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=ClickLogic-Non_Brand-Advertise_Business_CPA_D_yahoo-my-business&amp;utm_content=responsive-search-ads-0820&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwh-CVBhB8EiwAjFEPGdtpWWlZY2QQTVMzc33rRM4kk7jS2As11bI4wh_gn6vsp0wVzBDchxoCoYEQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yelp<\/a> and of course <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/answer\/7107242\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Business Profiles<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Often people can also submit reviews on these directories.

These can include anything from professional directories such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clio.com\/blog\/best-lawyer-directories\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">attorney directories<\/a> to review sites such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TripAdvisor,<\/a> which is a force in the travel, restaurant and hospitality industries.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Location-Based Directories<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Many organizations such as Chambers of Commerce publish location-based directories.

There may also be opportunities at news sites and online magazines among others. Look for opportunities that fit your business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Submitting in Volume<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We have only mentioned a very few places where you can submit your business listings. But there are many, many out there, and you should submit to as many as you can that are relevant to your business. Start with the big ones like Google Business Profiles, follow with industry-specific listings and location-based listings and finally look for additional possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>If all this sounds time-consuming, it can be. Yes, there are tools that can automate submissions. But you need to sift through and decide where your business should be lifted, and some you will probably end up doing manually.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Maintenance: As Important as Submissions<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Once you have submitted your business listings, you aren\u2019t finished. You need to maintain them. If there is a mistake in one of your listings, it can fan across the web as smaller directories pick up information from larger directories on their own. If you find an error, reach out to the site immediately to correct it, and do and audit to see if it has been replicated elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Forget Voice Search<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>An increasing number of people are using <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/business-voice-search-listing\/\">voice search<\/a> with apps and devices such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant and more.
