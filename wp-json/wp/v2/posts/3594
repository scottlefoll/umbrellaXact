You need to post regularly on your page so it appears active. If you let your page languish, it will not reflect well on your company. So, commit to your page before creating it.<\/p>\n<p>If you do set up a LinkedIn page, be sure to claim the URL with your company\u2019s name. It can then appear on search results when people search specifically for your company.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to set up your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/710\/create-a-linkedin-page?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn business page.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Network<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>LinkedIn is all about making connections and building community. Since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/business\/marketing\/blog\/lead-generation\/leveling-up-your-lead-gen-with-linkedin-top-tip-and-tricks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">four out of five LinkedIn members<\/a> drive business decisions, these are the people with whom you want to network. Start by inviting colleagues and others you know to connect with you on LinkedIn. Then you may want to connect with members your connections are already connected with, to people in your groups and finally to others you think would be good for your business. Although there are some restrictions on the number of invitations to connect that you can issue, there are ways to increase your available invitations.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have connected to LinkedIn members, you can easily interact with them and build relationships. After you have built a relationship and further established your credibility, that\u2019s the time when a contact will be extremely open to doing business with you.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3.

Write regular posts to grab attention and keep your audience warm and write longer articles to establish yourself as a thought leader in your field.<\/p>\n<p>Your posts and articles will appear in the feed of your highly targeted audience, and in some cases, LinkedIn will promote them if of great interest to others. You can also pay for boosts of your posts and articles. They will then appear in the feeds of a much bigger but highly targeted audience.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Join Groups and Contribute Value<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A great way to establish your own credibility and that of your company is to join LinkedIn groups that are relevant to your industry. LinkedIn groups enable you to interact with other professionals. You can ask questions, offer advice and share experiences.

If you have been adding value to the group you are both in currently, they are very likely to join yours.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s the point? Once you have targeted prospects in your group, you can address them all in one place.

Joining and creating groups helps you to give your brand a lot of visibility and generate leads.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7.
