After all, the first result that comes up on the first page of Google has an average <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sistrix.com\/blog\/why-almost-everything-you-knew-about-google-ctr-is-no-longer-valid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click-through rate of 28.5%.<\/a> Second position is 15.7% and third position is 11%. After that, it\u2019s a free fall with the 10<sup>th<\/sup> position garnering only 2.5% on average. And if you\u2019re on the second page of Google? Well, good luck.<\/p>\n<p>There is a lot to getting on the first page of Google, but it all starts with writing for SEO.<\/p>\n<p>SEO writing optimizes content so search engines can easily find it, easily understand what it is about, and once found, rank it above other similar content high in SERP. Following are 10 tips for writing for SEO and getting your content ranked high by search engines.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Write Quality, Original Content for Humans Not Search Engines<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You need to write for your target audience, for human beings. Google wants to give quality links when people perform a search. As Google has become more sophisticated, they are increasingly penalizing content that is written with an attempt to rank on search engines but which has little value for the human audience.<\/p>\n<p>What can you do to give value to your audience? Develop <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/customer-avatars\/\">buyer personas<\/a> where you have fleshed out roles, motives, challenges and interests and write to them.\u00a0 Address your audience\u2019s challenges, give them solutions, answer important questions in your industry, show how to do something useful. In other words, write about content your audience cares about and add some value. Concentrate on what your audience wants to see, not what you think the search engines want.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Find and Use Good Keywords<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Just because you should focus on writing for humans doesn\u2019t mean keywords don\u2019t matter. They very much do. Use keywords and phrases your customers are searching to help them find you.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need a tool to help you find the right keywords. Start with <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/home\/resources\/using-google-ads-keyword-planner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a>. You may also want to take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keywords-explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ahrefs<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/lp\/keyword-magic-tool-1\/en\/?kw=ahrefs%20keyword%20explorer&amp;cmp=AA_SRCH_Brand_Competitors_EN&amp;label=brand_competitors&amp;Network=g&amp;Device=c&amp;utm_content=643019437870&amp;kwid=kwd-593531303962&amp;cmpid=19410017654&amp;agpid=141660026381&amp;BU=Core&amp;extid=&amp;adpos=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA5Y6eBhAbEiwA_2ZWIeWOh21sF0RKyw0ERcRr_oTgr_tKukU5JugCtuFeUELlrDudfaZyZxoCX7QQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEMRush<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/app.neilpatel.com\/en\/ubersuggest\/?loginModal=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ubersuggest<\/a>. They will inform you what search terms people are using, the volume of the searches and a lot more.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you have your great keywords, don\u2019t overdo it. If you overuse keywords, Google will read it as spam and penalize the content. Use the keywords in a natural way scattered throughout the article including the metadata, the title and some of the subheadings.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t stop at just one keyword or phrase. Use related keywords that will help search engines interpret what the article is about. When choosing keywords, consider search intent. If someone is looking for pizza recipes, it doesn\u2019t help you if a search engine sends them to your pizza restaurant. Think about what words can you use to be sure your audience finds you. To learn more about that, check out our blog post about <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/search-intent\/\">search intent.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Don\u2019t be Redundant When Writing for SEO<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Be sure your content is original and that you don\u2019t repeat yourself in your article. Be careful copying even if it\u2019s legitimate, say, a legal blog post quoting a case. Quote what you need from the case, but don\u2019t overdo it. If you want them to read the entire case, provide a link. Use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyscape.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Copyscape<\/a> or similar services to check you aren\u2019t inadvertently copying too much from a source, even if you wrote the article yourself.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Link to High Quality Websites<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Some businesses appear to be afraid to link outside their own websites. Don\u2019t be. Linking to good websites shows both your audience and search engines that you have properly researched the article. It also provides your audience with additional valuable material should they want to take a deep dive.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Link to Material on Your Own Website<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Linking to other pages or posts on your own site is beneficial in multiple ways.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linking within your own site helps your audience find more materials of value to them.<\/li>\n<li>It shows your audience you are a reliable, credible source.<\/li>\n<li>It keeps your audience reading on your site longer, which of course increases conversions.<\/li>\n<li>It also helps search engines build an accurate sitemap.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But you want to link to material that is actually relevant to the content on the page. If you are just linking to products you want to move instead of information that clarifies an issue, you are only going to frustrate your audience.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. Make Good Use of Subheadings <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When writing for SEO, your subheadings are important both so your audience can see what your blog post or page is about at a glance and to help search engine crawlers understand your content. You don\u2019t need to use keywords in all your subheadings, but you definitely should be using them in some. This will go a long way to improving your ranking in search results.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. Formatting Matters<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Try to break up your content to make it more easily scannable. If you are debating between putting a section of content all under one subheading or two, always go with two. You want to use a lot of subheadings and break up your content.<\/p>\n<p>Keep your sentences short and your text readable. Formatting also counts. Use white space, bullets and subheadings to make your content easily readable and give your audience a fast idea what the article is about. Infographics and images also add interest and help make your blog post or other content more readable.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>8. Spend Time Writing Your Title<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t underestimate the power of a catchy title. Before your audience reads your brilliant blog post, you need to grab their attention with a good title. Try to use your primary keywords in the title. Address a challenge or a benefit\u2026 maybe be a bit mysterious. Try to be specific. There is nothing interesting about being vague.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>9. Make Metadata Your Friend<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Meta data is crucial to good writing for social media. Meta data helps search engines find your content. You should be writing meta data for every page on your site and also for images.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Title Tag<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The title tag is what people see when your article turns up in search results. The title tag (not to be confused with the title of the article) tells your audience what a page is about. You should use keywords in your title tag. It generally should not be more than 60 characters, but Google allows up to 70. You do not see the title tag when you actually go to the page.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Meta Description<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When you look at search results, a meta description appears below the title tag. It gives you more space to describe what is on the page. Once again, use keywords. You should not use more than 160 words for a meta description.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Image Meta Data<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You should write metadata for each image on your site to help search engines make sense of your site. Use keywords. You should write an image title, a meta description and alt text. The image title and meta description do not appear on the actual content page.<\/p>\n<p>Alt text describes the actual image. It helps if the image does not load or is being viewed by someone visually impaired who uses a site reader.<\/p>\n<p>You can also write a caption that appears under the image, but it\u2019s not required unless you feel the image needs an explanation.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>10. Write Content Long Enough to Cover the Topic<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Write long form content that is long enough to fully cover the topic. But don\u2019t be redundant and just go on and on for no reason. You usually want each page to be at least about 1,000 words. 2,000 words or more is fine as long as you have something valuable to say and are not just adding filler. If you can use other media such as video, that\u2019s also highly recommended.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Need Help with Your SEO?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you need help with writing for SEO or any of the many other aspects of SEO, schedule a free consultation with an Umbrella Local Expert.
