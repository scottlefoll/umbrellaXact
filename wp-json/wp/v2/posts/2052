Even if you do a great job of keeping your existing customers engaged and buying from you, you need new customers if you want to increase your profits.<\/p>\n<p>You probably know the story when it comes to new customer acquisition \u2013 that it can cost anywhere from seven to 10 times as much to attract a new customer as it does to retain an existing one. That can be true, but it doesn\u2019t need to be.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are three proven ways to generate new customers today \u2013 without breaking the bank.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#1: Start a Referral Program<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to bring new customers into your business is to ask your existing customers for help. You\u2019ve probably asked a friend for a referral at least once in your life. Most of us have. Your job, then, is to turn that instinct into a coherent program that helps you attract new customers. The statistics don\u2019t lie: a customer is four times as likely to make a purchase when they get a referral from someone they know.<\/p>\n<p>The first step is to decide how you will track referrals. Don\u2019t skip this step. There\u2019s no point in investing your time and energy in a referral program if you\u2019re not going to track your results and see how your program is performing. Your tracking method can be as simple as a spreadsheet. If you use a marketing automation program, it may have a built-in tracking system for referrals.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is figuring out how you will reward people who provide you with referrals. For example, you might offer customers a free or discounted product. If you provide a service, the reward might be a free month of service or even a cash bonus. Whatever your reward is, make sure it\u2019s something that will incentivize people to participate in your referral program.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you\u2019ll need to let people know about the referral program. If you have an email or text list, then you can use it to give subscribers the details and let them know how they\u2019ll be rewarded for successful referrals. Make sure to specify when the rewards will kick in \u2013 for example, after a new customer makes their first purchase or signs on for a service.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, track your results and adjust your program as needed. If you\u2019re not getting the results you want, you may need to revisit your rewards to incentivize your customers to make more referrals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2: Partner with Other Businesses in Your Area<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is no business that\u2019s so specialized that it doesn\u2019t share customers with other businesses. That means that you can partner with other businesses in your area to expand your customer base and grow your business.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note, here, that we\u2019re not talking about partnering with direct competitors. That doesn\u2019t make sense and it won\u2019t help you. Instead, look for businesses where there is some overlap between your target audience and theirs. For example, if you own a bakery, you might partner with a wedding planner or event venue. If you run an insurance agency, you might form a partnership with a local real estate agent or car dealership.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified potential partners, approach them to talk about doing some joint marketing. In some cases, your relationship may be a mutually beneficial referral program where you offer a discount if they refer people to you \u2013 and vice versa. Or you could package your products or services together to entice customers to patronize both of your businesses.<\/p>\n<p>The key here is to choose your marketing partners wisely. If there isn\u2019t a clear link between your audience and theirs, it won\u2019t be a good investment to partner with them. You should know going in that there\u2019s a reasonable likelihood that their customers are in the market for your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided on a partnership and figured out how to proceed, you\u2019ll need to advertise your packaged services or deals to the appropriate audience. Social media is a great place to do it, and sending emails to your respective lists can be effective, as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3: Focus on Social Proof<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Even if you already understand the importance of online reviews, there\u2019s a possibility that you\u2019re not using social proof to its fullest extent to attract new customers. Here\u2019s what you need to do.<\/p>\n<p>The first step is to claim your listing on every online review site where your business appears. To be sure you have them all, Google \u201cYour Business Name reviews.\u201d Visit every relevant link and, if you haven\u2019t already done so, claim your listing.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have claimed every listing, you should review your listings to ensure that the information about your business is accurate. Even if you have previously claimed the listing, double-check information including:<\/p>\n<p>&gt; Your business name<br \/>\n&gt; Your address<br \/>\n&gt; Your contact information (phone and email)<br \/>\n&gt; Your hours<br \/>\n&gt; Your prices<\/p>\n<p>You should also review any uploaded images and replace them with updated pictures as needed. For example, if you have installed a new sign outside your business, you should include a picture of it, so people can find you.<\/p>\n<p>If you have not responded to reviews in the past, it\u2019s time to start. Responses to positive reviews don\u2019t need to be long but you should post a quick thank you and a \u201cHope to see you again soon\u201d to let reviewers know you appreciate their feedback.<\/p>\n<p>For negative reviews, make sure to respond to new reviews within 24 hours. If the customer\u2019s problem has a quick fix, you can try to resolve it on the review site. More complex issues should be resolved offline, either on the phone or via email or chat.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, consider putting a widget on your site that displays reviews from sites such as Yelp and Google on your website. That way, anybody who visits your site will see the social proof they need to overcome potential objections and convince them to choose you over your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, it doesn\u2019t need to be prohibitively expensive to attract new customers. If you\u2019re willing to invest a bit of time and effort, you can implement all three of these suggestions right away \u2013 and start reaping the rewards for your business.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customer retention is essential but it\u2019s impossible for any business to grow without attracting new customers.
