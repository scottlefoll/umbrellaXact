Does it still make sense for your business to be <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\">advertising on Facebook<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is still a very vital platform, but whether or not you should advertise there depends on your business, what you sell and your audience. \u00a0For example, eCommerce ads tend to do very well on Facebook. B2B ads could do well on Facebook, but you might want to consider LinkedIn or other more business oriented channels first.<\/p>\n<p>Also consider that Facebook demographics have changed. Once frequented by a very young demographic, the Facebook demographic has aged. If you are trying to reach the youth market, you might be better off on Snapchat or TikTok. \u00a0Since 2015, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialpilot.co\/facebook-marketing\/facebook-statistics#:~:text=Facebook%20has%20over%2010%20million,Facebook%20charges%20%240.97%20per%20click.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">percentage of teens<\/a> on Facebook shrunk from 71% to 32% in 2022. This could be good or bad depending on your industry.<\/p>\n<p>Following are some major benefits that <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\">advertising on Facebook<\/a> offers businesses.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Has a Big Reach<\/h2>\n<p>In spite of the competition that has popped up over the years, people still use Facebook more than any other social media platform. So much so that in the United States, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialpilot.co\/facebook-marketing\/facebook-statistics#:~:text=Facebook%20has%20over%2010%20million,Facebook%20charges%20%240.97%20per%20click\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">81% of adults<\/a> have a Facebook account. These Facebook users often belong to a demographic many businesses want, because 75% of people who earn high incomes use Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to what some may think, the Facebook audience continues to increase by 2% each year. Currently, there are 2.96 billion monthly users worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>And let\u2019s not forget that Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram with its \u00a01 billion users. You can opt to have your ads displayed on both if you choose.<\/p>\n<h2>Return on Investment (ROI) Is Attractive<\/h2>\n<p>If Facebook advertising is a good fit for your target audience, and if you develop good creative, you can reach a very attractive ROI with Facebook advertising.

Creativity is critical.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to Nielson, the creative is responsible for 56% of ad campaign sales ROI.<\/li>\n<li>Google says it\u2019s even more at 70%.<\/li>\n<li>A study by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/news\/insights\/high-quality-creative-increases-ad-roi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta and research firm Nepa<\/a> reports that creative can drive up to a 2.7 increase in short term sales and 7.4 time increase in long term sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you just throw anything up there, don\u2019t expect much of a payoff.\u00a0 Good advertising is strategic. Test various aspects of each ad before committing to a large-scale campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>Target as Minutely as You Like<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook enables you to minutely target who sees your ads based on location, age, gender, interests and more. For small businesses, the ability to fine tune location targeting is particularly helpful.

That enables you to advertise to those with attributes similar to that of your winning list.<\/p>\n<p>The days of shot-gun advertising are long gone. Spend your money on your ideal prospects.<\/p>\n<h2>Facebook Offers Many Ad Options<\/h2>\n<p>No matter what kind of ad campaign you want to run, it\u2019s pretty likely that Facebook offers the format you want.
