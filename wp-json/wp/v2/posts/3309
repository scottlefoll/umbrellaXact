This is a mistake. Let&#8217;s see why.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Google Is Using Your Site&#8217;s Mobile Version for Search Ranking<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Be aware that these days, Google primarily indexes the mobile versions of websites for search result rankings. Google isn\u2019t ranking websites that are desktop-only at all. So, if you want to rank in Google search results, your mobile website better be in tip-top shape.<\/p>\n<p>The reason Google is emphasizing mobile sites is because today the majority of people access the Internet through smartphones and other mobile devices such as tablets. Last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/26935\/global-web-traffic-share-by-platform-per-region\/#:~:text=Roughly%2057%20percent%20of%20internet,this%20comes%20as%20no%20surprise.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">57% of Internet traffic<\/a> was from mobile phones. \u00a0By 2025, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/01\/24\/smartphones-72percent-of-people-will-use-only-mobile-for-internet-by-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73% of Internet users<\/a> will be accessing the Internet only from mobile devices. Needless to say, most Google searches are also done on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t Underestimate the Power of Mobile Devices for Social Media Sharing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If it\u2019s not enough for you that most Internet users are accessing the Internet on mobile devices today or that Google uses your mobile site to rank for search results, then consider the impact of social media. People mostly use social media from their phones or tablets rather than desktop computers. When people share information about your site on social media, readers are likely to click through to your mobile site. Once they get there, they expect a good customer experience.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>So, What Makes a Mobile-Friendly Website?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Your customers are constantly changing the devices they use. They switch easily from desktops to laptops to tablets to smartphones. They expect their experiences to remain seamless as they move from one device to the next. They want to find information easily without battling your website\u2019s interface. They don&#8217;t want to scroll horizontally to see an entire page. They don\u2019t want to squint to read your site. They don\u2019t want content and images to be cut off.<\/p>\n<p>The mobile version of your site is not going to exactly mirror your desktop site. For example, the user may need to scroll down to see some content that appears on one screen on their desktop. But no matter what device they use, your audience needs to be able to easily navigate, find information and read your site.<\/p>\n<p>Enabling users to navigate, find and view information on a small screen is a challenge when developing a mobile-friendly website. If you just shrink a desktop site, users may not be able to read the small text or see the small images. The entire site may look chaotic. Needless to say, Google is not going to rank a site like that in search results. Fortunately, there are solutions.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Here\u2019s What Web Developers Can Do to Give You a Mobile-Friendly Website<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When you work with a web developer, you will want to check that important issues that make a website mobile-friendly are addressed. Here are some of those issues.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Adjust for Screen Size<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are a few different ways that developers can deal with varying screen sizes among devices, but the easiest to implement and maintain, and the one recommended by Google is Responsive Web Design. It will automatically adapt your site according to screen size. Your URL remains the same as does your HTML code. To learn more, see <a href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/responsive-web-design-basics\/#viewport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Responsive Web Design Basics.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Adjust Navigation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Many desktop sites have elaborate navigation with many submenus. Extensive navigation choices are going to be almost unintelligible on a smartphone if not done right. Your developer needs to give a lot of thought to how your navigation will appear on your mobile site. As just a starting point, \u201chamburger menus,\u201d those menus that are three lines and open on a click, are a common solution that appear these days on mobile sites.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Give Them What They Want, When They Want It<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You need your web developer to do everything possible to help your customers on their journey when developing a mobile-friendly website. For an ecommerce site, that ends up with a purchase. For other sites, that may end up with a phone call. Whatever your ultimate goal, your website must provide the information your customers need when and where they want it in order to generate conversions. For example, put a link to shipping information on the shopping cart page. Don&#8217;t make customers search your website for it.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to make your customers&#8217; lives easier is to put <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/4x-conversions-with-ai-chatbots\/\">AI chatbots<\/a> on every version of your site. They enable customers to get quick answers from anywhere on your site 24\/7.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Use the Right Tools to Check Your Site and Fix It<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Good web developers do not just guess at how to present and fix a mobile site. There are standard issues they must check.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unreadable font size:<\/strong> It\u2019s not going to help you much if the font on your mobile site is so small your customers cannot read it. A good developer can program your mobile site so the font automatically scales to the screen size.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Incompatible plugins:<\/strong> Unfortunately, sometimes businesses use plugins that are not supported by mobile browsers. That means your site will not work correctly. Fixing it requires a redesign with newer, supported technology in order to develop a mobile-friendly website.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Page not telling browsers to adjust dimensions<\/strong>: Each page needs to signal browsers to adjust dimensions for the size of the device. This is part of the responsive web design we referenced earlier.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Content wider than the screen: <\/strong>If your content is wider than the screen of a smartphone, you will force your customers to scroll not just vertically but also horizontally. If you make them do that, they will not stay on your site for long.<\/li>\n<li><strong>So crowded users can\u2019t click: <\/strong>If the things on your website are too close together, your users will end up clicking the wrong item. This is a sure recipe for frustration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Yearning for a Mobile-Friendly Website?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re busy running your business.
