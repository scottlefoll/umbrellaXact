If you aren\u2019t marketing heavily with video, you need to change your ways.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Today, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisco.com\/c\/en\/us\/solutions\/collateral\/executive-perspectives\/annual-internet-report\/white-paper-c11-741490.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">82% of Internet traffic<\/a> comes from video. You can\u2019t ignore that!<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wyzowl.com\/amazing-video-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">86% of businesses<\/a> use video as a marketing tool.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wyzowl.com\/amazing-video-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">92% of marketers<\/a> value video as a marketing tool.<\/li>\n<li>A Forrester study showed that videos are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/guides\/2010\/05\/search-engine-optimization-for-video.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">53% more likely<\/a> to push you to the first page of search results than traditional techniques<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Short Form Video<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Short form video has become wildly popular, so expect to see more of it in 2023. If you are not sure what short form video looks like, think of TikTok and Instagram Reels as great examples.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s almost impossible to lose with it. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">90% of marketers<\/a> either increase or maintain their ROI with short form video.<\/p>\n<p>One reason short form videos can be so effective is because people are busy.\u00a0 Your company and its offerings probably are not at the top of their priority. list Expecting someone to watch a half hour video is asking a lot. That&#8217;s why short form videos may often reach more people and get your message across better that longer, more detailed videos.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Live Video<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If pre-recorded video is hot, live video is even hotter. Studies show that people watch live videos <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/marketing\/top-5-facebook-video-statistics-2016-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">three times longer! <\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Social Commerce <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Selling on social media isn\u2019t new, but it\u2019s become much more widespread. This is a trend that can only grow. It usually takes awhile for the majority of marketers to fully grasp how to use new channels. But now we have a contingent of marketers who understand the social media intricacies of advertising, organic posting,\u00a0 influencer marketing and integrating the nuts and bolts of ecommerce on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Social media platforms themselves have now built easy to use platforms for both selling and connecting to influencers.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1251145\/social-commerce-sales-worldwide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">alue of social commerce sales<\/a> worldwide is expected to increase from $992 billion in 2022 to $1,298 billion in 2023 and to $2,900 billion in 2025.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Influencer Marketing <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Influencer marketing long predates social media. No doubt businesses sent their wares to Ava Gardner in the 1940\u2019s and Lillian Gish in the 1910\u2019s and even Lillian Gish hoping they would be seen about town wearing their jewelry or makeup brand.<\/p>\n<p>But social media has driven influencer marketing to an entirely new level. It increased more than ever in 2022 and will likely continue to do so in 2023. A new <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hubspot survey<\/a> tells us that \u201cOver 1 in 4 marketers currently leverage influencer marketing and it offers the second highest ROI of any trend. \u201c<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t\u00a0 have to break the bank. Most businesses can well afford to work with social media micro-influencers. They may not be as well known to the public at large, but they\u00a0 still have tens or even hundreds of thousands of actively engaged followers.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>User-Generated Content<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #2a2b2c;\">Remember word of mouth marketing? Well today, word is spread through user-generated content. Think about what you can do to get your social media followers to produce content about your brand. After all, people are much more likely to trust other consumers than a company, because those consumers have nothing to gain by singing the praises of a product or service. Consumers are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20190220005302\/en\/Stackla-Survey-Reveals-Disconnect-Between-the-Content-Consumers-Want-What-Marketers-Deliver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">240% more likely<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #2a2b2c;\"> to find user-generated content more trustworthy than that created by a company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 21.0pt; margin: 0in 0in 12.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #2a2b2c;\">So, hold those contests, spread that hashtag, encourage social media reviews. Do what you can to encourage your following to spread the word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">Ubiquitous Customer Service<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There was a time when \u201ccustomer service\u201d was considered quite separate from marketing. Marketing was focused on the sale and didn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to the customer journey after that.<\/p>\n<p>But today, smart marketers understand that they must market at every touchpoint from the website to conversations with a customer service reps. Every time a customer interacts with your brand in any capacity, it influences their opinion of you.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s therefore no surprise that using social media for customer service will grow in 2023. \u00a0Companies have not been using social media for customer service for very long, but it\u2019s becoming more popular all the time, so much so that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/hubspot-blog-marketing-industry-trends-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 25% of marketers<\/a> direct message customers who need customer support. Some companies even use social media platforms such as Twitter as their primary channel for customer support.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this increasing now? One reason is that customer support on social media goes hand in hand with increased social media selling, another one of our trends.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>AI Chatbots and Conversational Marketing <\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3>Customer Expectations<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Immediate response:<\/strong> As customers become more demanding, it is incumbent upon businesses to better serve their needs in order to stay competitive. How demanding are they? Almost \u2154 of your customers expect you to respond <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/live-chat-go-to-market-flaw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">within 10 minutes<\/a> of their inquiries. \u00a0This applies not only to customer service but also sales and marketing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transfer of information:<\/strong> When your customers speak with your reps, they become easily frustrated if they have to explain their problems to one person, then be transferred to someone else and have to explain it all over again. It\u2019s already annoying enough to be transferred, but you can drive customers right up the wall if all the information they just painstakingly outlined is not transferred along with the call. And often it isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Help when they need it:<\/strong> Customers want help when they want help. But many companies offer customer service help only during limited hours, often the hours their customers are working, commuting or eating dinner. For most organizations, it\u2019s not feasible to have human customer service reps available 24\/7.<\/p>\n<p>Inquiries are not limited to customer service. If a customer has a questions about a product before they buy, getting an immediate answer may be the key factor in making a sale.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>AI Chatbots Help Solve These Issues<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>AI chatbots can chat with customers in a conversational manner. And they can do it anytime of the day or night. They can provide answers to common questions. And best of all, machine learning enables them to continue to improve.<\/p>\n<p>All conversations are tracked, so if there is something that must be handled by a human rep when they start work in the morning, they have a full record before reaching out to the customer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"vertical-align: baseline; margin: 12.0pt 0in 12.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #2e475d;\">When a customer is chatting with an AI chatbot, they feel like they are getting one on one attention, even though the AI chatbot may be serving many customers at the same time.
