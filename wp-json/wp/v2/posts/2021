They want to follow you, read your content, and learn something new about your business and what you have to offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two of the most popular social media sites are Facebook and Instagram \u2013 but you might be wondering if one is better than the other for your small business advertising. As a Facebook advertising agency, we have thoughts and we\u2019re ready to share them with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Facebook vs. Instagram by the Numbers<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many potential customers can you reach on Facebook and Instagram? The answer to that question can help to point you in the direction of the right social media site for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook has more users than Instagram, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/751\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.8 billion as of the end of 2020<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> compared to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/instagram-vs-facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one billion active daily users<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Instagram. While that\u2019s a big difference, it\u2019s important to note that Instagram\u2019s numbers are impressive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another key metric when considering your social media advertising options is the demographic information of users. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/facebook-stats-for-marketers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook skews older than Instagram<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with most users in the 25-34 demographic. The average Instagram user is under 30.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll need to think about who the people in your target audience are and where they\u2019re most likely to be before you decide between Facebook and Instagram.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Engagement on Facebook and Instagram<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When consumers engage with businesses and brands on social media, they have certain expectations. They don\u2019t want to be bombarded with relentless ads beseeching them to buy something. They want useful information, special deals, and engagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s start with Facebook. 40 million small businesses have a Facebook page and it\u2019s difficult to ignore that number. The chances are good that most, if not all, your competitors have a presence on Facebook. Regardless of whether you decide to make Facebook advertising a priority, you need to be there.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, Facebook business posts get <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/facebook-statistics\/#Facebook_business_statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average engagement of just 0.18%.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can be even lower if your page has over 10,000 followers. By contrast, the engagement rate on Instagram is significantly higher than that, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/instagram-statistics\/#:~:text=The%20average%20engagement%20rate%20for,and%20video%20posts%20(0.75%25).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coming in at 0.96%.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Purchases on Facebook and Instagram<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engagement is one thing but by itself, it\u2019s not putting money in your pocket. For that reason, our next metric is an essential one. Are your followers more likely to buy from you on Facebook or Instagram?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at raw numbers, Facebook comes out on top. According to the most recent data, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/facebook-statistics\/#Facebook_business_statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18.3% of all Facebook users have made a purchase on Facebook compared with just 11.1% of Instagram users.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s impressive but it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. There are some products that lend themselves more to Facebook advertising, particularly services and B2B products. Since there are more people on Facebook than on Instagram, it stands to reason that their numbers would be higher, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demographics come into play here again. Instagram boasts of being able to reach a youth audience (defined as people between the ages of 13 and 17) of 83 million. Facebook can\u2019t match that number, although it\u2019s undeniable that in some parts of the world, Facebook is more popular than Instagram.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Facebook vs. Instagram for Your Products<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re considering a social media advertising strategy, it\u2019s essential to think about which social media site will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Since most business have a presence on Facebook, there\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll find some people there who are interested in your products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, we\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t mention that Instagram offers businesses with visual and aspirational products a distinct advantage. For example, 50% of Instagram users who follow fashion brands say they have made a purchase on Instagram.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a product or service that lends itself to simple, visual advertising, then you may want to put more of your advertising budget into Instagram. By contrast, a company with an informational product or a service that requires more in the way of explanation may find Facebook to be preferable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Social Media Advertising Benchmarks<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things you should know about engagement and click-through-rates is that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialinsider.io\/blog\/social-media-industry-benchmarks\/#keyinsights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">both numbers have remained consistent on Facebook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As Instagram has attracted more followers, the engagement rates there have been creeping up and are, in many cases, higher than they are on Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t be advertising on Facebook. There are still more active daily users on Facebook than there are on Instagram. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/02\/28\/facebook-advertising-benchmarks#:~:text=The%20average%20conversion%20rate%20for,across%20all%20industries%20is%209.21%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average conversion rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Facebook across all industries as of 2020 is 9.21%, much higher than Google and far ahead of Instagram, where the average conversion rate sits at 1.08%. That\u2019s higher than Pinterest and Twitter, but still far behind Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Should Your Small Business Advertise on Facebook or Instagram?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s time to decide how to allocate your social media advertising budget. Which will it be? Facebook or Instagram?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have the time (and budget) to advertise on only one social media site, then we recommend Facebook. With greater reach and higher conversion rates than Instagram, it makes sense to use your advertising budget to reach as many people as possible \u2013 and Facebook is the best place to do that. The chances are excellent that most, if not all, of your competitors are on Facebook. That means you need to be there, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, some companies may have a target audience that\u2019s more in line with Instagram\u2019s demographics. Companies selling a visual and aspirational product or service may want to take advantage of Instagram\u2019s visual marketing and advertising options. Keep in mind that Facebook owns Instagram and cross-posting between platforms is easy and encouraged if you decide you\u2019d like to be in both places.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Umbrella Local, we work with small businesses every day to help them get guaranteed results on their social media advertising campaigns. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to read about our Facebook advertising services.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social media advertising isn\u2019t optional for small businesses \u2013 and if you\u2019ve been shirking on your social media game, it\u2019s time to step it up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":2022,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[119],"tags":[134,117],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2021"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/13"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2021"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2021\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2056,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2021\/revisions\/2056"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2022"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2021"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2021"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2021"},{"taxonomy":"table_tags","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/table_tags?post=2021"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
