Why wouldn\u2019t you be using Facebook to get in front of that part of their audience who could use your products and services?<\/p>\n<p>If you are planning to use Facebook to help sell your products, it only makes sense to be a presence that people see in varying ways. That means paid advertising of various types, creating a Facebook business page, making regular organic posts and possibly setting up a Facebook shop. The more your audience sees you, the more likely they are to convert.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Facebook Posts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Organic Facebook posts are a great way to engage with your customers and build loyalty. They can help you with selling on Facebook by making your audience aware of your company, engendering positive feelings and linking them to your website or Facebook shop. And they don\u2019t cost anything.<\/p>\n<p>Today, people like to have a relationship with companies or they are soon gone. \u00a0And that goodwill doesn\u2019t stop there. There is the added advantage that if your audience likes your posts, they will share them, and they will potentially be seen by like-minded people who will become your customers.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s all well and good, but remember that all your followers will not see all your posts.

What\u2019s popular? What bombs? Your organic social media feedback can help you determine the messages and creative to use in your paid ads. There\u2019s a lot to be said for free testing when it comes to selling on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Organic social media is a long-term game. You aren\u2019t going to get the immediate reach you do with paid advertising, but it can enable you to build relationships with your customers over time.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Facebook Ads<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\">Facebook ads<\/a> enable you to get in front of just right audience immediately.
