Whether through search engine optimization, social media efforts, paid advertising or other efforts, you want to generate traffic to your website. It\u2019s no surprise then that a recent survey found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/b2b-digital-marketing\/b2b-strategy\/b2b-marketing-trends\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">51%<\/a> of B2B respondents were allocating budget to website development in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>When working with a <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/website-creation-or-revamp\/\">website design company<\/a>, ensure you\u2019re getting a website that not only attracts visitors but engages them to stay and encourages them to take action and convert. Here are some tips for getting started building an effective website that attracts and converts your B2B buyers.<\/p>\n<h2>Prioritize Design<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most important elements of an effective website is its design and usability. The priority of any website design should be the user and their experience. Demand Gen Report\u2019s 2019 annual B2B Buyers Survey found that <a href=\"http:\/\/e61c88871f1fbaa6388d-c1e3bb10b0333d7ff7aa972d61f8c669.r29.cf1.rackcdn.com\/DGR_DG102_SURV_B2BBuyers_Jun_2019_Final.pdf?mkt_tok%3DeyJpIjoiTURabE9EQTNZbVprWWpJeSIsInQiOiJWS3FxRkFnN3kySXJRUG8xQTBGNEtqZjFEQVN3Z21JRTArZEdjMFU4UVFCMUhUTFpQem8zbU8wc3E3bXlDZ1l5aUZnUGIzTU56SERjSjBPc0d1UEV6UWZXSU1oMFlrWTBvM2FQVG5RYitDY1FwK2VQZWRcL1NvNVlRaTRPaXA4RWMifQ%253D%253D&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1586253825604000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGoKgQpHgrxAVUXQCcLOttm2V3AoA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">97% of B2B buyers<\/a> expect vendor websites to have relevant content that speaks directly to their needs. Therefore, your website should be easy to navigate and layout content and information that speaks to your audience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingprofs.com\/charts\/2015\/27454\/what-b2b-buyers-value-most-on-vendor-websites\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">37%<\/a> of B2B buyers said they will leave a vendor website due to poor design or navigation. When it comes to design, a B2B website should focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/10-essential-website-accessibility-tips-for-2021\/\">accessibility<\/a> and legibility over flashy design elements. The design should naturally fit your brand and be an online representation of your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Optimize for Mobile<\/h2>\n<p>We live in a multi-screen society \u2013 laptops, desktops, smartphones, tablets \u2013 and your website should be compatible with all of them. <a href=\"https:\/\/gs.statcounter.com\/press\/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">StatCounter Global Stats<\/a> found that mobile and tablet devices account for over 50% of internet usage worldwide compared to desktop. Add to that the fact that <a href=\"https:\/\/image-src.bcg.com\/Images\/BCG-Mobile-Marketing-and-the-New-B2B-Buyer-Sep-2017_revised%5B2%5D_tcm9-172106.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80% of B2B buyers<\/a> use a mobile device at work. \u00a0Over 60% reported that mobile played a significant role in a recent purchase.<\/p>\n<p>A mobile-optimized website design ensures that the user experience is not hindered, regardless of what type of device an audience member uses. The user should be able to navigate the site quickly and easily. Image scaling ensures the proper dimensions for mobile devices so that photos and graphics don\u2019t block copy or important information. \u00a0Avoid pop-up features, because they can be extremely disruptive on smaller screens.<\/p>\n<h2>Increase Site Speed<\/h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/page-load-time-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a>, the probability of a user leaving your site increases by 32% as page load time goes from 1 second to 3 seconds. Pages with a lot of photos, large files or unused code on the backend can increase load time. To keep visitors on your site, address these and similar issues to ensure your site loads quickly across all devices.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond creating a better user experience, Google\u2019s recent <a href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/vitals\/#core-web-vitals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Core Web Vitals<\/a> update now factors page speed when ranking sites in search results. Core Web Vitals are a group of quality signals Google measures and considers valuable for delivering a great user experience. Google notes that the metrics that make up Core Web Vitals will evolve over time as user needs and data change. The current vitals focus on three aspects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Largest Contentfulfvg 67jkmNHJ3BW2 M Paint (LCP) \u2013 How long a page takes to load<\/li>\n<li>First Input Delay (FID) \u2013 How long before a site becomes interactive<\/li>\n<li>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) \u2013 How much layout shifting occurs on a page (For example, when you go to click on a link but it moves causing you to click on something else)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/web.dev\/vitals\/#core-web-vitals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google<\/a> states, \u201cto ensure you&#8217;re hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads segmented across mobile and desktop devices.\u201d Working with a website design company that focuses on these areas can improve the overall user experience and improve your SEO and search rankings \u2013 helping more users find your website.<\/p>\n<h2>Create Value for Your Clients<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/e61c88871f1fbaa6388d-c1e3bb10b0333d7ff7aa972d61f8c669.r29.cf1.rackcdn.com\/DGR_DG102_SURV_B2BBuyers_Jun_2019_Final.pdf?mkt_tok%3DeyJpIjoiTURabE9EQTNZbVprWWpJeSIsInQiOiJWS3FxRkFnN3kySXJRUG8xQTBGNEtqZjFEQVN3Z21JRTArZEdjMFU4UVFCMUhUTFpQem8zbU8wc3E3bXlDZ1l5aUZnUGIzTU56SERjSjBPc0d1UEV6UWZXSU1oMFlrWTBvM2FQVG5RYitDY1FwK2VQZWRcL1NvNVlRaTRPaXA4RWMifQ%253D%253D&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1586253825604000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGoKgQpHgrxAVUXQCcLOttm2V3AoA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">48% of B2B buyers<\/a> rely on vendor websites when researching their purchase options. But once a client comes to your website, you need to be sure you are capturing your prospects\u2019 attention. One of the biggest mistakes companies make in their marketing is focusing on themselves rather the client. To gain a user\u2019s attention and stand out from your competitors, show them how you can solve their problems and add value to their business better than your competitors can.<\/p>\n<h2>Use AI Chatbots<\/h2>\n<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has reached a point where chatbots can have increasingly human-like conversations, allowing companies to leverage this technology to connect with more users. With 24\/7 availability, instant responses, omnichannel messaging and personalization features, chatbots can engage with your website visitors, answer their questions and encourage action any time of day.<\/p>\n<p>AI chatbots can also help you gain valuable insights into users visiting your website, which can help your sales team qualify leads. Some chatbots also offer features that sync directly to employees\u2019 calendars, giving them the ability to schedule meetings on your behalf. This can streamline the sales process for buyers and create a more positive experience with less back-and-forth emailing or calls getting sent to voicemail.<\/p>\n<h2>Emphasize Your Client Testimonials<\/h2>\n<p>Never underestimate the power of a testimonial! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.demandgenreport.com\/industry-topics\/content-strategies\/2746-b2b-content-preferences-survey-buyers-want-short-visual-mobile-optimized-content.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">97%<\/a> of B2B consumers rely on peer-generated content like testimonials and reviews. Highlighting <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/reviews-and-testimonials\/\">client testimonials<\/a> on your website can help potential buyers relate to and build trust with your brand. Let real people hear from real customers on why your product\/service is good.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Overlook High-Quality Content<\/h2>\n<p>Your website needs to put your audience first. Focus on creating high-quality content that answers your audience\u2019s questions, educates them and showcases your brand and services. For B2B businesses, compelling content that encourages engagement includes testimonials, case studies, blogs and whitepapers.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond creating content for your audience, you need to optimize your content to improve your search visibility and rankings. Web development services can provide keyword research insight, content creation and SEO knowledge to build a strategy that helps your website get found by the people who matter.<\/p>\n<h2>Incorporate Video<\/h2>\n<p>A video marketing insights company found that <a href=\"https:\/\/tubularinsights.com\/b2b-marketers-video-roi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">73% of B2B<\/a> marketers say video positively impacts their marketing ROI. You can use video to teach complex concepts, share stories from your clients and connect users to your brand and team.<\/p>\n<p>Video can also help improve your website\u2019s traffic. Research by Aberdeen Group found that marketers who use video receive <a href=\"https:\/\/awesome.vidyard.com\/rs\/273-EQL-130\/images\/Vidyard_Aberdeen_Impact_of_Video_Marketing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">41% more web traffic<\/a> from organic search than those who do not. As a result, video can help attract more users to your website and encourage them to stay engaged with your site.<\/p>\n<h2>Attract, Engage and Convert More Customers<\/h2>\n<p>An effective website is made up of multiple pieces. Elements need to be in place that help users find your website, keep them engaged with your site once they\u2019re on it and encourage them to take action with your company.<\/p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/website-creation-or-revamp\/\">website design company<\/a>, Umbrella Local has the team, knowledge and experience to design and develop beautiful websites optimized for search engines, accessible for all users and generate sales for your business. <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us<\/a> today to learn how we can enhance your website!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your website is the focal point of your online marketing strategy.
