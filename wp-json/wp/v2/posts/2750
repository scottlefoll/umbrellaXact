In order to raise your SERP (search engine result pages) rankings and increase traffic of qualified prospects to your website, it\u2019s not enough to just use some related keywords in your content. You need to understand the search intent behind the words people use to search.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Search Intent Is Important<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u201cSearch intent\u201d is simply the reason people have for performing a search. Let\u2019s say someone performs a search that includes the word \u201cpizza\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>People may have different intents when performing a search that contains the word \u201cpizza\u201d. They might want to find<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pizza recipes<\/li>\n<li>A place to order pizza for delivery<\/li>\n<li>Venues that serve pizza for a child\u2019s birthday party<\/li>\n<li>A specific pizza place a friend recommended<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Normally words other than \u201cpizza\u201d in the query will help indicate the intent. \u00a0You need to analyze the search and its context to try to determine that intent. Why? If your link on the SERP (search engine results page) takes your reader to a landing page that doesn\u2019t match their intent, you\u2019ve lost them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Understanding Context<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, people will use words that put their search into context. If they want to make a pizza at home, they might search for \u201cpizza recipes\u201d or \u201chow to make pizza.\u201d If they want to order a pizza, they might search for \u201cpizza delivery in Berkeley, CA\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Also be aware that Google makes certain assumptions depending on the terms used in a search. People turn to Google for relevant results, not a hodgepodge of unrelated pages that just use a particular term.<\/p>\n<p>Since providing results that meet search intent is extremely important to Google, if you want to rank well in SERP, search intent better be a critical goal in your SEO strategy. When your link directs users to pages that don\u2019t match their search intent, they leave quickly without clicking on anything. The Google algorithm notices.<\/p>\n<h2>Search Intent Categories<\/h2>\n<p>There are four basic categories of search intent. Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Informational<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Many Internet searches are just seeking information. People can search for information about recipes, directions, science, history, the weather, people, DIY projects and really anything else.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cWhen was Bill Clinton president?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cHow to make a pizza\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cWhat is a cat\u2019s normal temperature?\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If someone just types in a person\u2019s name such as \u201cMalala Yousafzai,\u201d they are probably looking for information on that person.<\/p>\n<p>Now be aware that Google will make certain assumptions beyond contextual words. It will show results higher in its rankings that most people are seeking. So, if you search for \u201cMars\u201d without any other indicators, you are going to get a lot of information about the planet and not so much on the ancient Roman god of war.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Commercial Investigation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When someone is searching with commercial investigation intent, they are past the point of just looking for general information, but they are not quite ready to buy. They want to investigate more details about products or services, often wanting to compare them. They intend to buy at some point, but not in the current Internet session. These users may search reviews among other things.<\/p>\n<p>Searches could be something like<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>HP budget laptop reviews<\/li>\n<li>HP vs. Asus laptops<\/li>\n<li>Top budget laptops<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Transactional<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Transactional search intent means the user is ready to buy now. They pretty much know what they want, so they want to get to the relevant product page. They are past the research phase and don\u2019t want to waste time being sent to a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>These searches may include the words \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201cshop\u201d or \u201csale\u201d. They may also include very specific product names.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Navigational<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Navigational search intent means the user is trying find a specific website. Therefore, these searches usually have company or brand names. Users might also add other information to try to get to the correct page such as a specific product page, a contact us page or a log-in page.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to Determine Search Intent<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Following are some factors you will want to consider when trying to determine search intent. But realize that the lines can be blurry. One search could have more than one search intent.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Keywords<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As a starting point, just use common sense to determine what people want to find with the words they use to search. As we\u2019ve already described above, look at the words themselves. For example, if the search includes \u201cHow to\u2026\u201d the search intent is informational. If it\u2019s just a company name without anything else, it\u2019s probably navigational.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>SERPs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>One of the most direct ways to determine if you are using a keyword that matches search intent is just to type it into Google and other search engines. What websites and pages come up in your search?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are bringing up a lot of blog posts, informational sites and sites such as Wikipedia, the search intent is informational.<\/li>\n<li>If you are getting some information about specific brands, comparative reviews and paid results at the top of the page, the search intent may be commercial investigation. The line between commercial investigation and transactional search intent can sometimes be grey.<\/li>\n<li>Transactional search intent results will include paid searches and reviews also, but you will also be taken to product pages where you can buy the products.<\/li>\n<li>Navigational search intent results should be obvious, since users are seeking a specific website and often a specific page on that website. The sought-after website should be at the top of the SERP, though there will be other websites as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Tools<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to figure all this out on your own. There are tools out there that analyze keyword intent such as one from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/lp\/keyword-intent\/en\/?kw=search%20intent&amp;cmp=AA_SRCH_Keyword_Magic_Tool_EN&amp;label=keyword_magic_tool&amp;Network=g&amp;Device=c&amp;utm_content=560975553493&amp;kwid=kwd-371141751597&amp;cmpid=12563760176&amp;agpid=129366669293&amp;BU=Core&amp;extid=&amp;adpos=&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6pOTBhCTARIsAHF23fLsQv5YQALQ7H41Hqb75Y9lVuLVmzeKDX5EV9BuKK9ECWMbyH613esaAnslEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Semrush.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>For What Type of Search Intent Should I Optimize?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>How heavily you should weight your SEO for different kinds of search intent depends on your business and your goals. But you should not ignore any of them.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, you want those with commercial and transactional search intent to easily find the relevant pages on your website if you are selling products or services. But don\u2019t ignore optimizing for navigational search intent, or people looking for you may end up finding your competitors instead.<\/p>\n<p>But what about informational search intent? Someone just looking for information may not be ready to make a purchase, but there are other benefits to this kind of traffic. Google likes sites that provide valuable, relevant content. That means your search rankings are likely to improve if you optimize for informational search intent. Then those who are ready to make a purchase will have an easier time finding your website.<\/p>\n<h2>Know Your Goals for Each Piece of Content<\/h2>\n<p>Instead of just throwing content onto your site without a plan, know what you want to accomplish with that content. Do you want to educate your audience and provide them with valuable general information hoping to drive traffic and views?<\/p>\n<p>Or do you want to give detailed information about a product hoping to make an immediate sale?<\/p>\n<p>Make sure the content to which you lead your users matches their search intent in order to keep them happy, improve your sales and better your search rankings.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">Umbrella Local Can Help<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most business owners and executives are busy working on their business and don\u2019t have time to become SEO experts.
