This means that Google will no longer be tracking how a user interacts with third-party sites and will not show ads to users as they travel the Internet based on their browsing history. This change is part of Google\u2019s ongoing initiative to develop a set of open standards to enhance privacy on the web.<\/p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/search-engine-advertising-sem\/\">Google ads management services<\/a> helps many businesses drive relevant, qualified traffic to their websites. Google remains an effective advertising channel, but this shift may change your business\u2019s advertising and SEM strategy. Fortunately, it will not affect first-party cookies collected on a business\u2019s own site. Let us explain.<\/p>\n<h2>What Does This Mean?<\/h2>\n<p>When you visit a website, the website you\u2019re on will send cookies (pieces of code) to your computer. Your computer stores this information in the web browser you are using (Chrome, Safari, etc.). This code could then be used to track you as you travel to other sites and show you targeted advertising relating to what you viewed on the website where you picked up the cookie.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, this third-party data could be purchased or otherwise obtained so advertisers could build a profile of interests based on the sites users visited and use that data to deliver focused Google ad content. An example of this is if a user\u2019s browsing history included multiple sports-related sites, they may be targeted to receive advertisements for team jerseys or game tickets as they travel to other websites or social media.<\/p>\n<p>In its announcement of the change, Google\u2019s Director of Product Management, Ads Privacy and Trust, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/ads-commerce\/a-more-privacy-first-web\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Temkin, wrote<\/a>, \u201cKeeping the Internet open and accessible for everyone requires all of us to do more to protect privacy \u2014 and that means an end to not only third-party cookies, but also any technology used for tracking individual people as they browse the web.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>How Does This Change Impact Your Business?<\/h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s shift for Chrome will no longer support the use of third-party cookies to track users across the web and Google Ads will no longer allow advertisers to use third-party data for ads targeting. This will limit a company\u2019s insight into new audiences that haven\u2019t engaged with their brand. Some fear that this shift will give an advantage to large companies and brands like Amazon and Coca-Cola, because they will have the resources to purchase various consumer targeting data from companies like Experian.<\/p>\n<p>The end of third-party cookies is not the end of all types of tracking however. While Google plans to phase out third-party cookies on its Chrome browser, first-party cookies will remain. First-party cookies are pieces of data collected through your business\u2019s own website. These cookies allow the browser to remember user information, such as your username and password and language preferences.<\/p>\n<p>First-party data can give a competitive advantage since your business maintains exclusive ownership of it. As Google phases out third-party cookie tracking, Google ads management services and developing strong relationships with users can help businesses build an alternative successful marketing strategy. This is why many experts are suggesting businesses start to leverage their first-party cookie data.<\/p>\n<h2>Ways to Leverage First-Party Data for Google Ads<\/h2>\n<p>First-party data is more relevant to your advertising goals since it is information about your existing visitors and customers. By learning from your current website visitors, a Google advertising agency can help you develop an effective marketing strategy that encourages these users to take action and convert and provide keyword insight to target new visitors.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create more opportunities to collect first-party data.<\/strong> In these situations, users consent to share their data (email address, location, etc.) in exchange for something. Whether it\u2019s an email list sign-up or information download, businesses should create ongoing value exchanges with users to collect, store and use first-party data.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Use Google Analytics and Google Search Console. <\/strong>These tools gather information specific to a website domain and help a business see what search queries drive traffic to their site, what pages are converting and more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Continued Benefits of Google\u2019s Paid Advertising<\/h2>\n<p>Despite the loss of third-party cookies, Google ads management services continue to be effective because they allow businesses to deliver ads to users who are the most likely to be interested in their products and services while filtering out those who aren&#8217;t. Google\u2019s Display Network reaches <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">90%<\/a> of Internet users worldwide and HubSpot reported Google Search advertising as one of the paid channels with the highest ROI.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefit #1: Targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Google still offers customizable ad options to maximize marketing dollars through different targeting information, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keywords:<\/strong> Businesses can choose which words are used to show their ads when users search for those terms. They can also add negative keywords for any terms or phrases they do not want their ads to show for. For example, a high-end apartment complex may include \u201caffordable apartments\u201d in its negative keywords to avoid showing in those search results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Demographics:<\/strong> Businesses can choose the age, geographic location and language of the users they are trying to reach.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Devices:<\/strong> Ads can appear across all types of devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) or businesses can adjust which devices their ads appear on. For example, a company selling mobile apps may only want its ads to appear on mobile devices to encourage immediate action.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Benefit #2: Control Over Budget<\/h3>\n<p>Another benefit of Google paid advertising is that a business only pays when someone clicks on their ad(s), also referred to as pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. Since there is no minimum budget for Google ads, advertisers have better control of the money they are putting toward paid advertising.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefit #3: Measure and Manage<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most significant benefits of paid advertising is the ability to quickly measure and manage your advertising efforts. By seeing which ads are getting clicks and which ones aren\u2019t Google ads management services can help you make informed decisions regarding your budget to boost your return on investment (ROI). <a href=\"https:\/\/economicimpact.google.com\/methodology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google estimates<\/a> that businesses receive $8 in profit through Google Search and Ads for every $1 they spend on Google Ads.<\/p>\n<h2>Reach Buyers Looking for You<\/h2>\n<p>In recent years, Google continues to innovate and make changes to its services to put emphasis on creating a positive user experience. While these changes are ongoing, Google continues to be a leader in search and advertising, making Google ads an important part of any business\u2019s marketing strategy.
