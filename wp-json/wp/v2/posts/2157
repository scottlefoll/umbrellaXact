Whether you want to take your business to new heights or are looking for your first marketing channel, it\u2019s important to be aware of all the options from <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/pay-per-revenue-marketing\/\">social media advertising<\/a> to search engine marketing and everything in between.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the pros and cons of each channel allows you to choose one that will yield the best results for your business. Keep in mind that an omnichannel approach has proven to increase ROI. Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. Search Engine Marketing and Pillar Content<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s never too early to position your business as the go-to place for information, and website pillar content is a tool that you can use to get there. Pillar content is long-form content that covers more detail than your general blog posts. A pillar content pages should provide a comprehensive overview of a topic, which means you can learn a lot in one place.<\/p>\n<p>Pillar content is great for search engine marketing (SEM). Metrics such as time spent on a page and bounce rate tend to be excellent on pillar content pages. It signals to search engines that the content is valuable and should be ranked above the competition.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, pillar content is rarely standalone. Instead, it\u2019s used as part of a hub &amp; spoke model. Pillar content acts as the \u201chub\u201d that includes topic clusters which contain links to the \u201cspoke\u201d pages. This setup creates an SEO-friendly internal website linking structure. Finally, pillar content is a valuable resource that visitors will link to naturally. This results in a search engine results page (SERP) ranking boost. And everybody wants to rank high in Google search results.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">2. Pay-Per-Revenue with Cashback Offers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most small businesses have small marketing budgets that they need to use to full potential. Therefore, high ROI marketing channels are the priority. That\u2019s why\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/pay-per-revenue-marketing\/\">Pay-Per-Revenue marketing<\/a> should be at the top of your list. The model is simple. You advertise your business for free and only pay a small fee when you receive a sale.<\/p>\n<p>This allows you to scale your marketing budget as the volume of sales grows. It\u2019s a low-risk marketing strategy, because you will not spend huge chunks of your budget without generating sales.<\/p>\n<p>The cashback offer part of the equation boosts the marketing effort, because it provides buyers with an incentive. Giving a small percentage of the sale back to the customer as cashback pays off. It might be in the form of another sale, because it provides real value.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">3. Social Media Advertising<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Consider buying ads on several social media advertising platforms such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/marketing\/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/instagram-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/twitter-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/marketing-solutions\/how-to-market-on-linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn<\/a> to capture your audience. It\u2019s a fast way to get social media attention until you can grow an organic following.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to use all social media platforms, and small businesses probably shouldn\u2019t focus on more than three. Choose platforms that are popular with your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to deploy the right type of ads. For example, pictures with a light tone work best on Instagram. On LinkedIn you may want to choose a more formal tone.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">4. Social Media Low-cost Influencers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that getting the right influencer to promote products and services can skyrocket sales and brand recognition. However, an increasing number of influencers understand their value and therefore charge a lot of money to promote brands. \u00a0That\u2019s not an ideal situation for small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of looking for the most popular social media accounts, concentrate on recruiting new to medium-level influencers who will not charge a premium. For example, if you are looking for YouTube influencers, then consider ones with a subscriber range of under 500K.<\/p>\n<p>Choose influencers that are within your niche to access a targeted audience. Some influencers who love your products might be willing to promote your brand free of charge or at least if you send them free stuff. Many influencers love to receive free products. Influencer marketing is a high ROI social media advertising strategy that enables small businesses to compete with the biggest brands in any industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">5. Retargeting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Retargeting enables you to put your ads in front of people who have already shown an interest inf your brand.<\/p>\n<p>For example, site retargeting is where someone visits your website, and then you can follow them on other websites and social media to show them ads for products they showed interest in on your site. Maybe they clicked on an item, but didn\u2019t buy it.<\/p>\n<p>Search retargeting enables you to put relevant display ads in front of people as they surf the web or visit social media based on their keyword searches even if they never visited your website.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">6. Loyalty Programs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s often said that selling to new customers is five times more expensive than selling to existing customers. Of course, that depends on your niche, but there is little doubt that loyalty is valuable. Therefore, you need to work hard on maintaining a good relationship with your buyers so they come back for more purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Loyalty programs are an excellent way of getting buyers to stick around. A worthwhile program might provide discounts, free samples, early access to new products and more. The extra sales generated from the loyalty program will make up for the cost of investment.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">7. Refer-a-Friend<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Word of mouth is an excellent way of generating new business. Create amazing products, and it will happen naturally. However, you can help the process along by incentivizing people to talk you up to their friends.<\/p>\n<p>You might incentivize people to bring in new customers with a small cash amount or a discount on the next purchase. You\u2019ll need to make the reward worthwhile for the strategy to gain traction. Also, make sure that both the recruit and new customer receive a reward in the process.<\/p>\n<p>And beyond incentives, just ask your current customers to refer their friends.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">8. Competitions and Prizes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Run competitions where you generate a buzz that provides an opportunity to capture participant email addresses for future contact. For the cost of one of your products, you could potentially generate thousands of new subscribers to your email marketing list.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that the prize is exciting enough for people to take notice. Also, consider making the winner selection process an event. It could be a live-stream where people see you picking a winner out of a hat or using software to select a winner.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1.6875em;\">9. Local SEO<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some small businesses will mostly sell to people who live locally. In such cases, dominating local SEO can catapult such a business to the top. Sound relevant to your business? Start by filling out a free Google My Business account. It\u2019s remarkable how many businesses don\u2019t have one, yet they offer the potential to drive a significant amount of sales.<\/p>\n<p>Add location-based keywords in your page titles, headings and other content. Next, create location web pages for each neighborhood that you\u2019re targeting. They have a much higher chance of ranking in searches for local businesses than generic pages.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The nine advertising ideas for small businesses above have proven to work and are scalable.
