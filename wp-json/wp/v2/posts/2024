With the right information and the right SEO agency, you can get the job done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trial and error will only get you so far. At Umbrella Local, we\u2019ll help you drill down to identify the best ways to improve your rank with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/why-seo-marketing-is-critical-post-covid-19-era\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay per result SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With that in mind, here are Google\u2019s top five ranking factors for 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#1: Consistent Updates with Engaging Content<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The top ranking factor for 2021 is content related and that should come as no surprise. Google\u2019s priority is providing searchers with relevant and useful content. In other words, it\u2019s time to look beyond keywords and focus on the user experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One area of content creation that\u2019s particularly important is how you structure your content. You should be using H1, H2, and H3 tags. These tags help Google to classify your content and deliver it to the people who are most likely to benefit from it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s no fixed rule about content length although you should be sure to cover topics thoroughly. You should also update your content regularly. Google prioritizes fresh content over content that\u2019s been around a while.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#2: Backlinks<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google has indicated that it may eventually phase out backlinks as a ranking factor, but they\u2019re still essential in 2021. A quality backlink should come from an authoritative site and act as a vote of confidence in your website and content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be challenging for small businesses to acquire quality backlinks but working with a reputable SEO agency can help. There is no benefit to using \u201cblack hat\u201d SEO tactics to build links. A few quality links are going to be more valuable to you than a host of spam links.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One technique to try to acquire more backlinks is to use a tool such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.link-assistant.com\/seo-spyglass\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO Spyglass<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which allows you to piggyback on your competitors\u2019 backlinks to build backlinks of your own. Simply plug in two or three of your competitors\u2019 URLs and Spyglass will tell you which sites are linking to them and not to you. You can then approach the linking sites to try to get them to link to your content, a strategy that will likely work since they are already linking to other sites in your industry or sector.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#3: Keyword Optimization<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword optimization still matters to Google but not in the way it used to. The game in 2021 is less about keyword saturation and more about semantic saturation. In layman\u2019s terms, that means using your most important keywords and related language throughout your content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that Google\u2019s priority is providing quality content. You should always prioritize readability over keyword use. Natural-sounding language that includes keywords and related terms is going to get you the best results on Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to using keywords in your content, you\u2019ll also need to incorporate them into your tags and metadata. It\u2019s especially crucial to use your main keyword in your title tag and meta description. Keep in mind that while a \u201cpure\u201d use of the keyword might be preferable, it\u2019s better to include connective words if they improve readability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#4: Search Intent<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do people want when they look for your website? If you can\u2019t answer that question, then the chances are good that you aren\u2019t optimized for search intent. Understanding search intent can help you to create the type of content that will rise to the top of Google\u2019s SERP for your keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if someone searches for lasagna, they probably want a recipe. If you type that search term into Google, or if you ask Siri, \u201cHow do I make lasagna?\u201d you\u2019re going to get a choice of sites with lasagna recipes. Searching your most important keywords and reviewing the top results can help you understand what people want from your content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Voice search optimization services can help you optimize for search intent. You should be prioritizing voice search because as of 2020, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginewatch.com\/2020\/09\/02\/voice-search-seo-guide-trends-and-best-practices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 million Americans own at least one smart speaker<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That number is likely to grow, and we expect that voice search will continue to dominate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research will help you understand the types and formats of content your target audience wants. Then, you can craft optimized content that will help improve your search ranking and attract more visitors to your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#5: Core Web Vitals<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our final ranking factor is one that Google has recently added to its list of ranking factors. The search engine plans to use Chrome User Experience report data to rank websites. The goal is to prioritize the user experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial elements identified as Core Web Vitals include the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Largest Contentful Paint, which measures the time it takes for a web page\u2019s main content to load, ideally less than 2.5 seconds.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Input Delay, which measures the time for a page to become interactive, ideally less than 100 milliseconds.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cumulative Layout Shift, which measures the amount of unexpected layout shift of your visual content, ideally less than 0.1.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these three factors, Google has added a related Page Experience Signal, which will take into account the following things:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTTPS security<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile readiness<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safe browsing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intrusive interstitial guidelines<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intrusive interstitials are things like banner ads and pop-ups that interfere with the user experience on a website. Their inclusion in the search algorithm is in line with Google\u2019s ongoing determination to prioritize the user experience. Google has released a detailed developer\u2019s guide for the Page Experience Signal. You can find it <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/guides\/page-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to remember that there are other factors that play a role in your search ranking, including internal links, Schema markup, and your use of tags. However, many of the factors that were previously seen as minor have been incorporated into Core Web Vitals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to getting the SEO results you want in 2021 is to partner with an SEO agency with the experience and expertise to deliver the pay per result SEO you need. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/pay-per-result-seo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to learn how Umbrella Local can help!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google\u2019s search algorithm might be proprietary, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t crack the code to dominate search in 2021.
