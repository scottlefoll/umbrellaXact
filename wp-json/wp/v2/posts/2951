Gone are the days when you could blast out advertisements to customers and expect them to buy from you and remain loyal. Sure, advertising has its place, but today it\u2019s all about listening to your customers and engaging with them. Your customers want that personal touch. The more you forge real connections with your customers, the more loyal they will be. That not only means you will be able to optimize your profits during the good times, but it also means your business will ride out the bad times.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses and consumers exchange over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/news\/facebook-messenger-by-the-numbers-2019-infographic\/553809\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">20 billion text messages<\/a> every month on Facebook Messenger. Now think how much more attractive conversational text messaging is when messages can be exchanged on multiple platforms and devices.<\/p>\n<p>Connecting with your customers online goes beyond even putting a chat function on your website and engaging them on social media. Your customers are on the go, and they expect to be able to reach a business no matter where they are and no matter what device they are using. And today\u2019s customers much prefer texting to calling you on the phone. In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/pr.liveperson.com\/2021-10-13-New-report-finds-83-of-consumers-worldwide-would-browse-or-buy-products-in-messaging-conversations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">74% of consumers<\/a> said they are more likely to do business with a company if they could message rather than call them.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look further into why two-way <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/conversational-texting\/\">conversational text messaging<\/a> is a must for your business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Is Conversational Text Messaging?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/conversational-texting\/\">Conversational text messaging<\/a> enables a two-way conversation between a business and its customers. It\u2019s pretty much the same as text messaging your friends and family. There is interaction, not just the business blasting marketing promotions at its customers. At its best, conversational text messages are brief, informal and personalized.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unlike live chat functions on a website in that<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either the customer or the company can initiate the conversation.<\/li>\n<li>Your customers don\u2019t need to go to your website to start a conversation or respond. They can start a direct conversation with you from their phone, tablet, desktop or laptop.<\/li>\n<li>The conversation can be saved and returned to later, just like your texts with friends.<\/li>\n<li>Your current landline or VOIP number can be set up for conversational text messaging. No need to use or publish multiple numbers.<\/li>\n<li>It can provide instant communication. If you can\u2019t have a human available 24\/7, you can supplement with automated responses including directing people to detailed FAQs and other information. Then the rep can contact them later and see their messages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Conversational messaging is most effective when implemented across multiple channels. These conversations need to be able to occur on whatever platform customers prefer, whether it\u2019s Twitter, WhatsApp, or another messaging service. These services combine the conversational element of texting with the rich capabilities of websites and apps, so messages can include graphic elements that allow people to complete transactions without leaving the platform.<\/p>\n<p>By keeping the line of communication open at all times, conversational messaging helps businesses provide a positive customer experience. This can help build brand identity and customer loyalty, and lead to an increase in revenue.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>People Read Almost All Text Messages<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When you send a text message, there\u2019s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slicktext.com\/blog\/2018\/11\/44-mind-blowing-sms-marketing-and-texting-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">98% likelihood<\/a> your customers will read it.
