Restructure Your SEO Strategy<\/h3>\n<p>One aspect in which voice searches differ from typed ones is that long-tail keywords dominate voice queries. Here, people ask questions in a conversational tone, and so the questions or keywords are usually long. For example, for a written query one could type \u201c<em>pet shops near me<\/em>.\u201d But for voice queries the question will likely be \u201c<em>where can I find a pet shop near me?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can adjust your SEO for voice search optimization:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/intl\/en_pk\/home\/tools\/keyword-planner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google\u2019s Keyword Planner<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Answer the Public<\/a> to find the long-tail keywords and question keywords that you should be targeting in your content.<\/li>\n<li>Then update the keywords in the meta tags and URLs. It helps search engines know what your content is about and optimizes it for SERPs.<\/li>\n<li>Create location-specific pages for your business and use conversational language.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember that sometimes the result that ranks number one in typed searches is not the same that shows up in voice queries. That\u2019s because each targets slightly different keywords.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Focus On Google My Business (GMB)<\/h3>\n<p>Did you know <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/_qs\/documents\/914\/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">four out of five customers<\/a> use search engines to find local business information? And then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/_qs\/documents\/914\/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search_research-studies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50% of the customers<\/a> who use a mobile phone for local searches visit the location.. So, to optimize your website for voice searches, start by optimizing your local SEO, specifically the Google My Business page.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can work on improving your website\u2019s local visibility:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target keywords with your location such as <em>plumber in Lakeview, Chicago<\/em> or <em>vegan <\/em><em>dessert store in Clear Lake, Houston.<\/em>\u00a0 That will help your website show up in the results for queries with the keywords <em>near me<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Add <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/the-unspoken-rules-of-effective-online-reputation-management\/\">reviews on Google<\/a> and other review sites that might be popular in your industry. Google Chrome was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/268299\/most-popular-internet-browsers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most widely used<\/a> browser in 2021, so\u00a0 adding reviews on Google helps boost your local SEO.<\/li>\n<li>Update information on your Google My Business page. That can include store timing, parking, location and delivery options.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Update Your Content<\/h3>\n<p>To optimize your website for voice searches, you need to first understand why people are using the voice search option in the first place. It\u2019s usually because they need quick and accurate information. For that, you should add high-quality content on your website that answers the searcher\u2019s intent quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some tips.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write in a conversational tone.<\/li>\n<li>Create answer targets to long-tail keywords in a way that directly resolves the user\u2019s query. Google or Siri sometimes only display one answer in the voice-search results. So target answers should help your content rank in voice searches.<\/li>\n<li>Since most users use the voice search option to look for local business, update your content to include information on local events or activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The key is to focus on answering questions, keeping local intent in mind and creating a better framework for your website so it\u2019s easier for search engines to find the content.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Make Your Website Mobile-Friendly<\/h3>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/voice-search-for-local-business-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">58% of people<\/a> use mobiles for voice searchers, you no doubt already know that your website must be mobile-friendly. You can use professional SEO services to improve your website or make the changes yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Some tips for making your website mobile-responsive are to<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a theme that is compatible with various devices.<\/li>\n<li>Adjust button sizes to give the best user experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Start by running a website audit on Google Analytics. Check the bounce rate and visit duration of mobile visitors to see where your website stands in mobile-friendliness.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Improve Website Speed<\/h3>\n<p>Page load speed is important for both typed searches and voice searches because Google and other platforms need to show answers immediately but especially for voice searches. That means if your website loads quickly, then it\u2019s better optimized for voice searches.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some things you can adjust to improve your website speed.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use compressed videos, images and graphics to improve speed. You can use Gzip for that.<\/li>\n<li>Reduce plug-ins on your website.<\/li>\n<li>Use a better hosting provider.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Help Is at Hand<\/h2>\n<p>A Bright Local survey reports that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/voice-search-for-local-business-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">46% of voice search users<\/a> use it daily to find information and local businesses.
