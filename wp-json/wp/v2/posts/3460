But while trying to increase your sales, don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s just as important to reduce business costs.<\/p>\n<p>Ben Franklin is famous for espousing that \u201cA penny saved is a penny earned,\u201d but we aren\u2019t talking pennies. You can save thousands every year with a bit of help.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s examine how businesses lose money every day, every month, year after year.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Regular Overcharges<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The bills roll in every month, and most of us just pay them. We are so used to them that we usually don\u2019t examine them in any detail every month. But that doesn\u2019t mean your monthly bills are correct.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a good chance you are paying more for some of your regular services than your competitors are. Maybe that doesn\u2019t make a big difference in a month, but as the months roll by, you can see your competitive edge start to slip particularly if you are overpaying for multiple services.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Mistakes on Your Monthly Bills<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Even if your rate is ok, that doesn\u2019t mean you can trust your monthly bills. They are often full of mistakes. And mistakes are much more frequent than you probably think. For example, did you know that around 85% of telecom bills contain mistakes? 85%!<\/p>\n<p>That level of mistakes can have you paying up to 20% more than you should each and every month.<\/p>\n<p>A Gartner study called\u00a0<em>North American MSBs Seek Cost-Saving Opportunities\u00a0<\/em>reports that \u201cTelecom bills for voice and data are often riddled with errors, not discovered for many years.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Unexpected Late Fees<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Utility companies, banks and other companies make a fortune on late fees. And often you didn\u2019t even know you were late because of bizarre billing cycles and other known triggers. Check your monthly bills. Are there fees that keep appearing that you don\u2019t understand? They may be late fees you don\u2019t even know you have been paying.<\/p>\n<p>Telecom bills are just one example. There is a saying that \u201cWhat\u2019s inspected is respected.\u201d Make sure you are checking your bills. It\u2019s a basic go reduce business costs.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Payment Plans Your Company Has Outgrown<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Is your business growing? Maybe you started out with you and your partner drawing up a plan on a napkin in a diner. But not you have employees, partners, a whole lot more vendors and a bigger space.<\/p>\n<p>Now that your situation has changed, you will want to review your various payment plans from utilities to printers, copiers and scanners. The bigger your company grows, the more likely you are to become eligible for more favorable rates. If you are using a lot more quantity, it\u2019s time to renegotiate. Once again, if you don\u2019t, you are putting your company at a competitive disadvantage.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Contracts That Weren\u2019t That Great to Begin With<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>A lot of business services are negotiable. But that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is a good negotiator.<\/p>\n<p>Even if your company has not grown or changed, every once in awhile approach your vendors and their competitors to see if you can score better rates. When it comes to reducing your business costs, you should not just assume that nothing can be done.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Inaccurate Meter Readings<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Another source for errors and lost money is mistakes on meter readings. Inaccurate meter readings and common, and they could be costing your company thousands of dollars each year. For example, not that long about over 7,000 utility customers in Austin were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kxan.com\/news\/local\/austin\/thousands-to-get-credits-after-meter-reader-error-led-to-high-summer-water-bills\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compensated for excess payments<\/a> made due to inaccurate meter readings.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s hard to check on your meter readings yourself, and you can\u2019t expect the utility companies to diligently pursue mistakes that are to their benefit. But it needs to be done to reduce business costs.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>A Chainsaw Instead of Scissors<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s great to get top level service, but do you really need all the bells and whistles you have been paying for? It\u2019s not great service if you aren\u2019t even using it. Don\u2019t pay for what you don\u2019t use. Check all your services and make sure you aren\u2019t paying for more than what you need. It may make sense to change to a different plan.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Tax Exemptions You Should Take \u2013 But Don\u2019t<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are many tax exemptions designed to help businesses like yours. If you are doing your own taxes or have an unsophisticated tax preparer, you may be missing some of these or you may not be claiming the full amount to which you are entitled. As just one example, you may want to check whether or not you received the exemption to which you were entitled through the Employee Retention Credit related to Covid relief.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Need Help Reducing Business Costs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Keeping your costs down is just as important as making sales.
