Some businesses do. Maybe they\u2019re located in areas where competition is minimal. Perhaps they have a great referral program that helps them attract new customers even with a website that\u2019s not optimized. Whatever the reason, they\u2019re doing fine without SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this sounds like you, there\u2019s good news and bad news. The good news is that you\u2019ve survived. The bad news is that you\u2019ve been lucky, and all luck runs out eventually. In 2021, SEO is more important than ever before. Here\u2019s what you need to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SEO by the Numbers<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes a statistic is worth a thousand words, and that\u2019s absolutely the case with SEO. Here are some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 numbers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that illustrate why SEO is essential in 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">92.96% of all traffic comes from one of these three sources: Google search, Google image search, or Google Maps.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">53.3% of traffic to websites originates with organic search.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less than 1% (0.78%) of Google searchers look beyond the first page of results,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO drives more than 10 times as much traffic as social media content.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">None of this means that your social media marketing is a wasted effort or that you shouldn\u2019t keep posting videos on YouTube. What it does mean is that the time to ignore SEO is over. Almost all organic search traffic in the world happens thanks to effective SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Without SEO, Potential Customers Won\u2019t Be Able to Find You<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online marketing requires good SEO, both on your website and any place your business appears on the web. It increases your company\u2019s visibility and brand recognition, and without it, potential customers may not even know your company exists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also worth noting that your SEO must account for the searcher\u2019s intent. If someone is looking to buy your product now, you need to make sure they know they can do that on your site. That means optimizing for words that indicate intent such as \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201ccompare.\u201d Opti<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mizing for keyword intent is an essential element of SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/seo-101\/seo-statistics\/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">numbers from Google<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tell the story. In desktop searches, the top organic search result gets 32% of all clicks; in mobile search, the number drops a bit \u2013 but only to 26.9%. That means that if you\u2019re not prioritizing SEO on an ongoing basis, you are likely to miss out on the organic traffic that could bring new customers to your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you run a home remodeling service in Atlanta Georgia you\u2019ll want to rank locally for keywords with intent like: \u201ckitchen remodeling Atlanta\u201d because optimizing for keyword intent and listed on the first page of Google, your website could be seen (depending on the search volume for your chosen keywords) by 400-500 searchers who intend to buy. Other \u201cintent\u201d other examples include:\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c___ near me\u201d \u201c____ reviews\u201d \u201cbest____\u201d \u201c____ quote\u201d and \u201c___deals\u201d.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good on page SEO will ensure that your company website appears on the first page of Google search results. However, off-page SEO has just as much to do with your visibility online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2020, Google has confirmed that PageRank, which evaluates the quality of backlinks, is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/google-pagerank\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">still part of its search algorithm<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s essential to make link building (and link review) part of your SEO strategy in 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective SEO helps your company build a strong and consistent brand presence across the web. You\u2019ll have greater brand recognition and more authority if your company information is consistent, whether it appears on your website, in an industry publication, in an online directory, or on your social media pages. Consistency builds trust and consumers are more likely to buy from companies they trust than from companies they don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SEO Creates a Seamless Customer Experience Across Channels<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a seamless <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/customer-experience\/16-statistics-on-why-omnichannel-is-the-future-of-your-contact-center-and-the-foundation-for-a-top-notch-competitive-customer-experience-02326116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">omnichannel experience<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for both potential customers and existing customers is a must for every business in 2021. People who are in search of products or services like yours may find information about you in a variety of places other than your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your social media pages and posts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your online directory listings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your review listings<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your YouTube videos<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your emails and tweets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your app<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When someone encounters your brand for the first time somewhere other than your website, they are likely to look for your website. You need to be sure that your optimization \u2013 both on your site and in your online listings and content \u2013 is cohesive and seamless. That means using the same keywords in a way that allows people to find you wherever you are online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your cross-channel experience relates directly to both on-page and off-page SEO. Your customers should feel confident that they understand your business and its products or services wherever they find it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SEO is Constantly Changing<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest mistakes that businesses make with their SEO is thinking that they can optimize once and forget about it for years at a time. SEO is not a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d endeavor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many reasons that SEO can change. Back in 2014, the Mobilegeddon update to Google\u2019s algorithm made mobile search a priority. Companies that weren\u2019t agile in responding had their search rank destroyed when it was released.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2020, more searches are done using voice than by typing keywords. We already mentioned that in the section about outdated SEO, but you must constantly be aware of how people are finding you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most recent example has to do with how current events can change search intention virtually overnight. The COVID-19 pandemic went from feeling like a distant problem in February of 2020 to something that affected every person in the United States (and the world) by the middle of March.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local businesses took the biggest hit with COVID-19 lockdowns. Owners and managers had to adapt to offer things like home delivery, curbside pickup, and virtual consultations. People who didn\u2019t have an agile SEO strategy already were at a disadvantage because they had to scramble to update their web content and help customers find their new COVID-related services and products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As vaccines roll out, it is reasonable to expect that the businesses that had to adapt to quarantines and lockdowns in 2020 will have to adapt yet again to whatever the future brings. We may see a true return to business as usual or new concerns about public health may lead to an as-yet-understood hybrid situation where businesses continue to offer both in-person and contact-free services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line is that without an agile, well-thought-out SEO strategy in 2021, many small businesses will fail. Your best bet is to research keywords and SEO strategies now and plan to revisit your strategy as the year progresses. Building in agility to your strategy will enable you to stay on top of whatever 2021 brings.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>92.96% of all traffic comes from one of these three sources: Google search, Google image search, or Google Maps.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":2016,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[48],"tags":[131,81],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2015"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/13"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2015"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2015\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2028,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2015\/revisions\/2028"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2016"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2015"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2015"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2015"},{"taxonomy":"table_tags","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/table_tags?post=2015"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
