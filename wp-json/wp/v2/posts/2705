And don\u2019t overstuff your content with keywords, or Google will interpret it as spam.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Metadata<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For people to find your site, it\u2019s important to write effective title tags and meta descriptions. You should Include your primary keywords in your meta title. Write your title tag to attract attention and entice people to click.
