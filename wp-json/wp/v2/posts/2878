When you do a local business search, Google will show some top Google Business Profiles at the top of the first page along with maps that pinpoint the locations of those businesses.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if someone wants to visit a Thai restaurant in the Marina neighborhood of San Francisco, they might search for <em>Thai food Marina San Francisco<\/em> and get the below result. Notice that Google Business Profiles and a map appear at the top before articles that discuss Thai restaurants in the Marina district.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2971\" src=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Google-Search-screen-shot-300x233.png\" alt=\"example Google local SEO search result\" width=\"353\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Google-Search-screen-shot-300x233.png 300w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Google-Search-screen-shot-1024x796.png 1024w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Google-Search-screen-shot-768x597.png 768w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Google-Search-screen-shot.png 1035w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/answer\/7091?hl=en#zippy=%2Crelevance%2Cdistance%2Cprominence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According to Google<\/a>, local search engine results page (SERP) rankings for Google Business Profile are primarily based on three factors: relevance, distance and prominence. So, location isn\u2019t everything. If Google\u2019s algorithms determine that a business a bit farther away from you (but still close enough to visit) is more likely to have what you want, it\u2019s going to rank higher in local search results. One thing is certain: you have to earn a high Google Business Profile ranking. You can\u2019t buy it.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>A. Relevance<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Relevance is how well a Google Business Profile matches your search. It\u2019s important that you add enough detail to the information you provide for your Google Business Profile for Google to get a good handle on what your business does so the algorithms point relevant searches to your business.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>B. Distance<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This one is pretty obvious. If someone searches for \u201cThai restaurants in San Francisco\u201d they probably are seeking a nearby place for dinner. They don\u2019t have much interest in a Thai restaurant in LA or even elsewhere in the Bay Area such as Berkeley.<\/p>\n<p>If someone is searching for Thai restaurants in the Marina in San Francisco, or if the search is originating from the Marina neighborhood (without any location information other than San Francisco) and Google can tell the search comes from the Marina district, then the Google algorithm will favor restaurants in the Marina district not just anywhere in San Francisco.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>C. Prominence<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Prominence refers to how well known a business is. If a place is well known to people offline, it is more likely to rank higher than a business that few know about. Google will also factor in information across the Internet such as links, directories, articles, reviews, etc. to help determine prominence. Increasing your number of online reviews and positing ratings can help your business in this area, as can good SEO.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Get on Local Directories and Double Check the Basics<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Your listings just begin on Google Business Profile. To further improve local SEO, list your business on additional directories where your customers can find your business. These could be directories of local businesses in your area or industry\/profession specific directories such as those for attorneys.<\/p>\n<p>Check anywhere your business is listed or mentioned online and make sure the information about the name of your business, website link, address, phone number, hours of operation and what your business does is correct and consistent. You may think we don\u2019t need to mention this one, but you would be surprised.<\/p>\n<p>Some places to check are your own website, your Google Business Profile, directories such as Yellow Pages, Facebook and other social media accounts, search engines such as Yahoo and Bing, Apple Maps and review sites relevant to your business such as TripAdvisor and Yelp.<\/p>\n<p>There are tools to help you monitor your online consistency including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/listings-management\/start\/?sm2workspace=seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this one.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Track Your Online Ratings and Reviews<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Online ratings and reviews are crucial to the success of any business today. They also affect your Google search rankings. Be sure you stay on top of them. Though this was written for marketing agencies, you may want to take a look at this article about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.umbrellaus.com\/business-reputation-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to manage business reputations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Optimize for Mobile for Good Local SEO<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Remember how we told you that 88% of people who do a local search on a mobile device call or contact a business they find in those results within 24 hours? That\u2019s really all you need to know (though there is a lot more) about why you immediately need to optimize for mobile devices if you have not already.<\/p>\n<p>That means building site that is responsive to mobile, has fast-loading pages and provides easy mobile navigation among other things.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Stay Active on Google Business Profiles and Social Media<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t just throw your Google Business Profile and social media accounts up and forget them. Shared social media posts can help you tremendously with Google search algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you are constantly pointing to your location in your social media posts. We cannot tell you how many times we have tried to <span style=\"font-family: 'Poppins',serif; color: #505050;\">figure out the location of a business from their social media account and couldn\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>And while you are posting to your social media, don\u2019t forget to update your posts on Google Business Profile. Just giving your address, phone and type of business isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s a process.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6. <\/strong><strong>Publish Local Content<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If your business is local, your website content should reflect that. Sure, you can write about general topics, but always look for ways to write about topics or news relevant to your local audience. You may be able to become the voice for your industry in your local area.<\/p>\n<p>What resources can you publish that will be of help to your customers and prospects? Publish some valuable, informative information. Everything you publish should not be sales-oriented. Before you make a sale, you must gain trust and credibility.<\/p>\n<p>If you have more than one business location in an area, you may want to create similar content for each on your website but with a localized flair. For example, a personal injury law firm with offices throughout the greater New York City area could publish separate (but not identical) blog posts about car accidents in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Writing customer success stories is a great way to add local content to your website. Write them for all the areas you serve.<\/p>\n<p>Publishing valuable local content is absolutely critical to good local SEO.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7. Create Local About Us Pages <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If your business is local, your <em>About Us<\/em> page should not only give the basics about your business, but also inform people about your involvement with the community. Does your business sponsor a little league team? Did you hold a charitable event to help a local children\u2019s hospital?<\/p>\n<p>If have a local business with multiple locations in the area, you may want to publish separate About Us pages for each location. Each of these pages must be unique. \u00a0As with any About Us page, you will want to include<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name address and phone number of the business<\/li>\n<li>Hours<\/li>\n<li>Descriptions specific to each location<\/li>\n<li>Promotions, particularly those specific to each location<\/li>\n<li>A few local testimonials<\/li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/12\/03\/google-maps-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Map <\/a>relevant to each location page<\/li>\n<li>Any other information specific to the location such as parking information<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>8. Get Local Backlinks<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.umbrellaus.com\/recipe-for-good-backlinks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting quality backlinks<\/a> from prominent sites that point back to your own is important for the SEO of any business website. Links from credible websites to your own indicate to Google that yours is a reputable company with products and services people want to find. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.umbrellaus.com\/get-quality-backlinks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many ways to get backlinks.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If your business is local, you will also want to be sure some of your backlinks are from other local businesses and organizations. You may want to guest blog on high domain authority websites of local business or partner with local businesses and influencers so they link back to you. Another way to get valuable backlinks is to be a donor or sponsor of a local charity or organization (such as the afore-mentioned children\u2019s hospital and Little League team) which should then link from their websites to yours.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9. <\/strong><strong>Optimize Everything<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Whenever you post new content, you need to think about optimizing it for search, particularly local search if possible. \u00a0That includes paying attention to keywords, URL, title, title tag, headings and meta description as well as writing content that is truly valuable to your audience.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>10.\u00a0 <\/strong><strong>Continuously Audit Your Local SEO<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>SEO, whether local or not, is not a one-time project. It\u2019s an ongoing process. The best way to be sure your site is up to snuff is to periodically perform comprehensive audits.<\/p>\n<p>You will want to look at how your website it performing overall and how each page is performing. How does that performance stack up to that of each of your competitors?<\/p>\n<p>Also check your Google Business Profile. How is it ranking in SERPs?<\/p>\n<p>Are directories and review sites bringing business to your website? Which are successful and which are not?<\/p>\n<p>How to perform in depth audits and determine what should be audited is an extensive topic in itself, but here we just need to make you aware that you need to stay on top of performance.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Umbrella Can Help You Reach Your Audience with Local SEO<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There is a lot to discuss about local SEO.
