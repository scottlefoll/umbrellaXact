This is an important aspect of <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/search-engine-advertising-sem\/\">search engine marketing<\/a>. A negative keyword list adds a block against information-based searches on your ads and do not show up in results to those not concerned with buying anything.<\/p>\n<p>By information-based searches, we mean those searches aimed at how to do something (rather than buying), such as building a bookcase. If you are selling designer bookcases, you only want people who are buying bookcases to click on your ad, not those who want instructions or blueprints on how to build one.<\/p>\n<p>When you do a search on Google Chrome for a product or service, you will see ads listed first in the top rows of results. They are clearly marked as an ad above all other blue website links and may also show images of the product. The negative keyword list you added blocks people from ever seeing your ad who only want instructions, based on their search terms.<\/p>\n<p>If you did not have your negative keyword list in place and these searchers clicked on your ad and then left, you would be spending a lot of money for no purchase results. The idea of using negative keyword lists is to help you save money and bring in only those buyers who want to purchase your product.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads are placed on Google Chrome search results as well as on the Google Display Network. Facebook and Amazon platforms also use pay-per-click targeting options but are different from the Google Ads in application, so this post addresses only Google Ads. Next is how to build that negative keyword list.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Determine Your Negative Keyword List<\/h2>\n<p>There are several ways to build your negative keyword list. The first way is to do it manually which will take some time to pull together. If you sell <em>hand-made embroidered silk drawstring purses<\/em>, your negative keyword list will include <em>leather purses<\/em>, <em>leather handbags<\/em>, <em>cloth handbags<\/em>, <em>clutches<\/em> and <em>wallets, <\/em>but not<em> silk drawstring purses<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If selling <em>lever-back diamond earrings with 22k gold<\/em>, your negative keyword list would include <em>diamond post earrings<\/em>, <em>lever-back diamond earrings with 14k gold<\/em>, <em>lever-back diamond earrings with 10k gold<\/em>, <em>lever-back emerald earrings with 22k gold<\/em>, <em>sterling silver lever-back diamond earrings<\/em>, and more. That is everything not included in your offer.<\/p>\n<p>For restaurants in local search, always include your city name in positive keywords for your ads to stay targeted at the local population. Build your negative keyword list by entering excluded areas beyond your city, such as in the next county. If your restaurant is in San Diego, California, your negative keyword list would include San Francisco, Sacramento, San Jose, and Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>If your restaurant focuses on Indian food, but not steak or fish dishes, then add <em>steak<\/em> and <em>fish<\/em> to the negative keyword\/phrases list.\u00a0\u00a0 Now you can see what a negative keyword list is and how it can target your ad effectively to your customers. If you feel uncertain about doing local search engine marketing, but want to have it done correctly, use a PPC agency to get you set up and running efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>Another manual process is if you already have your descriptive keyword (positive) list handy from your Google Ads account, begin adding each one in the Google Chrome search box. See what pulls up in the search engine results pages (<a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/hub\/seo\/serps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>SERPs<\/strong><\/a>). When you enter in a keyword or phrase, Google Suggest (Autocomplete) will show a drop-down list of possible queries you could be searching for. Choose those results that you do not want to trigger your ad for viewing and add them to your negative keyword list.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Applied Negative Keyword\/Phrases List by Type<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are three types of negative keywords\/phrases you use for viewer search engine marketing campaigns: exact match, phrase match and broad match. Here is what each one does for your campaign, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/2453972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Google Ads Help<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Negative broad match<\/em><\/strong> \u2013 if viewers search for a phrase which you have included in your list of negative keyword phrases, even if the words are not in the same position, your ad will not show to those viewers. But if one keyword included in your negative broad match is used (but not the others), then your ad will show.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Negative exact match<\/em><\/strong> \u2013 If viewers search for a phrase included in your negative keyword\/phrases list, using the same position order of the phrase, your ad will not show. But the ad will show if there are other words included in that phrase.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Negative phrase match<\/em><\/strong> \u2013 your ad will not show if the search included the same negative keyword phrase in the same position order, even when there are other words included. If symbols are included, the ad will show. Include those negative keyword\/phrases with symbols added, like ampersands (&amp;), accent marks commonly found in French words (\u00e9), and asterisks (*) along with the same keywords without symbols, according to Google Ads Help.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Negative Keyword Lists for Display and Video Campaigns<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When applying negative keyword\/phrases lists to displays and videos, add on category exclusions to enhance blocking these from showing everywhere. This includes various websites and mobile apps with sensitive content that do not match with your campaign message.
