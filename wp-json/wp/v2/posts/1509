Crime Scenes, Biohazards, Accidents, Pest Elimination, Hoarding, you name it, David and his team have probably tackled it.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat makes us different is that we handle the cleanup of situations that you won\u2019t, can\u2019t, or shouldn\u2019t. We remove the stress of hazardous and often mentally anguishing events\u201d, says David.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David O\u2019Brien is the owner of Rapid Responders. A Boston native, David moved to Las Vegas in 2008 to take advantage of the great weather.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David is what we like to call a Local Biz Hero, a self-made entrepreneur who brings true value to his community. High standards of professionalism and the strong work ethic of small business owners like David are the infrastructure of the Las Vegas economy.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every dollar that David makes goes back to supporting the local business ecosystem and the community as Rapid Responders supports those in need. David and his team sponsor a homeless feeding program on weekends.\u00a0 He will oftentimes donate items obtained through hoarding cleanup to local charities as well.\u00a0 And, of course, he\u2019s a raving Raiders fan as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We sat down with David for a quick interview &#8211;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>So, David, why do you do what you do?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWell, it\u2019s a crazy business for sure, but it can be very rewarding. For example, when you assist parents cleaning up after a child\u2019s suicide in the home they are truly grateful for not having to deal with it.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>How did you get into this profession?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was working for a towing company and a friend asked me if I knew anyone that could clean up a biohazard situation. I looked into it and found very few local companies qualified at the time and realized there was a niche to be filled, so that was the birth of Rapid Responders.\u00a0 And by the way, we are fully licensed, insured and bonded in any locality we work.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1524 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/download-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"606\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/download-3.jpg 606w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/download-3-300x222.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px\" \/><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Being a hands-on owner David works directly with many people. We asked him what\u2019s the most unusual situation that ever happened to you on the job?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cProbably our first job. It was an apartment complex where a resident had passed away and was not found until the odor became overwhelming to the other residents. Obviously it was a very nasty scene and we learned a lot on that one! \u201c<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>If you could share one tip with the readers for choosing a cleanup firm, what would it be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWell, there are many aspects to a cleanup. Biohazards, chemical hazards, disposal of human remains, etc. that the average person is not capable of handling. We are trained and licensed to handle these situations safely and expeditiously. So it definitely pays to call for professional help. \u201c<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, for those of you who are looking for a hazards cleanup firm for any type of remediation situation, David and the Rapid Responders team should be your first choice.
