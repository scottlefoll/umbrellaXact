West Valley is truly home to Kyle having lived there from the ripe old age of 1. He specializes in heat\/air systems specially designed for the AZ dry air climate ensuring his customers stay comfortable all year long.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat makes us different is that we\u2019re family-owned with a strong foothold in our local community and my customers all have my personal phone number and even know where I live! My six years as a Marine veteran undergirds our commitment of honesty and integrity in our relationships with all our customers.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1521 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/download-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"424\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/download-1-1.jpg 424w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/download-1-1-300x245.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" \/><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kyle, married with 4 great kids is the owner of \u201cKyle Wilson Heating and Cooling, LLC\u201d, a full-service HVAC company providing everything from preventative services to repairs to full installations Although not quite native-born he was raised here with strong ties to the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kyle is what we like to call a Local Biz Hero, a self-made entrepreneur who brings true value to his community. His very high standards of professionalism, his strong work ethic, and a deep desire to earn the trust and respect of his customers and peers is why small business owners like Kyle are the backbone of the Phoenix economy and especially in the West Valley.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every dollar that John makes goes back to supporting the local business ecosystem and the community as \u201cKyle Wilson Heating and Cooling\u201d supports several charities but has a special heart for St Judes and Troopers for America.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We sat down with Kyle for a quick interview &#8211;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do you do what you do?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI felt I could bring a more personal and consultative service to our community, particularly in an industry that has more than its fair share of shady operators. My motto is \u2018No Inflation. Just Integrity\u2019. I refuse to overcharge. I want my customers to feel and know they received all they paid for and more.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>How did you get into this profession?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAfter learning the trade from probably the most knowledgeable HVAC guy in America, I was challenged to go it alone, some saying I couldn\u2019t do it, that I wouldn\u2019t make it. Well, you don\u2019t tell a Marine he can\u2019t do something! It\u2019s been a great time building our business over these past 7 years with the wonderful customers I call Friends. I love providing honest and professional heat and air service to my customers<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Being a Marine and working lots of jobs in the West Valley, Kyle runs into lots of different folks. We asked Kyle about some of his memorable customers\u2026?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWell, the West Valley has lots of retired folks and most are very patriotic with a great love for America. So with my background in the Marines, I often find myself enjoying sharing stories with other veterans and folks just wanting to say thanks for my service and the service of all our veterans. These are some of the greatest people in the world and I\u2019m proud to be able to serve their A\/C needs. \u201c<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>If you could share one tip with the readers for choosing a heating &amp; cooling contractor, what would it be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFirst, (and this is a bit self-serving but true) is it family-owned? That really does make a difference in how someone looks to their relationship with the community. My wife is a nurse, helps with the books, I train a nephew in the business just to help him get some real world experience. My Dad is my best friend\u2026So family is important. Second, do they charge for diagnostics or is that part of the overall cost? In other words, be careful of a company that wants to charge you just to see what\u2019s wrong with your system.\u201c\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Thank you, Kyle, for sitting down with us and sharing a bit of your story.
