However, the competition is very high, and it will be difficult for you to stand out unless you have a clear social media advertising strategy. Adapting to new social media trends can help you build an effective strategy and make you stand out in the crowd. Here we have compiled a list of social media trends that you need to be aware of for 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><b>Ephemeral content will keep gaining popularity<\/b><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By saying ephemeral content, we&#8217;re talking about the trending short-duration content that disappears within 24 hours of postings. Facebook and Instagram stories are perfect examples of this type of content.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, people&#8217;s attention has become very short, and their content consumption has also changed. This is the reason for content formats like stories&#8217; popularity. They&#8217;re short, addictive, and interactive in a way that users can spend hours scrolling through one story after another.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a Hootsuite report,\u00a0 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hootsuite.com\/pages\/social-media-trends-report-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">64%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of marketers have already incorporated Instagram stories into their strategies or planning to include them. Another study revealed that brands post a story once in four days, and the number will likely increase in 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><b>Social commerce will continue to expand<\/b><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brands have long used social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest to sell their products. Social commerce has become new retail for businesses, and the trend is getting stronger with each passing day. Soon it&#8217;ll become a mainstream retail channel with other mediums like offline stores and websites. Social networks are introducing pro-selling features like shoppable posts. Which means they are also continuously evolving to become retail platforms.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the recent survey, Hootsuite asked their clients what they were trying to achieve by using social media. By far the most popular reason was to increase acquisition of new customers. The second most popular reason was to raise brand awareness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><b>Video content will dominate social media<\/b><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, people averagely watch as long as 2.5 hours of online video daily. Moreover, people prefer watching videos to understand a product or service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, video is one of the most engaging forms of content, beating other content types, and soon, it will dominate social media. Whether it is short-form videos such as stories or those famous on TikTok, or long-form content on YouTube, videos are the future of social media content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In their <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cisco.com\/c\/en\/us\/solutions\/collateral\/executive-perspectives\/annual-internet-report\/white-paper-c11-741490.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">annual internal report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cisco stated that by 2022, 82% of all online content would be video content. It is proving how important it is to start creating videos to stay relevant in the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren&#8217;t currently creating videos, it is high time to include them in your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social media advertisement strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, especially Facebook. If you don&#8217;t have expertise in this regard, avail services of a good <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook advertising agency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><b>Influencer Marketing will continue to rise\u00a0<\/b><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencer marketing is going to gain more popularity. Today, social media is dominated by influencers who are getting paid heavy amounts to promote brands. A sheer rise can be seen in the number of influencers on social media, and businesses are also increasing their marketing spend on influencer marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in influencers costs brands very little than running paid ad campaigns, yet it delivers good results. Brands tend to achieve a variety of marketing goals from influencers and not just generating leads. These are the main reasons why influencer marketing is continuously getting more robust and bolder.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of collaborating with 1 or 2 influencers, marketers work with a whole network of small and relevant influencers. These kinds of influencers take <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social media advertising<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the next level and cost much less.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><b>More brands will go live<\/b><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2019, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/live-video-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in five videos published on Facebook was live<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In 2020, the numbers could be higher because many brands were forced to take events, conferences, and other marketing experiences online.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to Covid-19, many brands shifted online and used Instagram, Twitch, Facebook, and Twitter to stream Q&amp;As, tutorials, events, and other content types. This helps them keep their followers engaged with their brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Live chats are an excellent way to gain your audience&#8217;s attention and make important announcements, mainly when the businesses are restricted and lockdowns are imposed worldwide due to pandemics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By looking at the continuous rise in popularity of live streaming, you should include it in your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social media advertising strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><b>More regulatory control and legal scrutiny<\/b><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media has been very beneficial for brands, but certain negatives have come to light in recent years. Security and User data privacy are such issues that have made the headlines for social networks like Facebook.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social platforms can be easily used to collect information about anyone and misuse that information. There are allegations against specific social networks that they sell their user data to other companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to these allegations, social networks and regulatory bodies will tighten their rules and put more policies in place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be in your best interest to follow your country&#8217;s rules and regulations while creating a social media advertising strategy. If you&#8217;re planning to utilize a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook advertising agency&#8217;s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> marketing services, choose the best among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><b>Facebook advertising success is tied to the consumer lifecycle\u00a0<\/b><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The online marketplaces are becoming more saturated with each passing day, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/facebook-advertising-with-guaranteed-results\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook advertising<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> costs continue to rise.
