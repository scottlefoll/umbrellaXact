Put simply, it\u2019s the process of keeping track of what\u2019s being said about your brand online. To take it one step further, it often includes amplifying the positive mentions and doing damage control for any negative mentions.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that most ORM tips and tricks assume that your company has people whose sole focus, 40 hours a week, is managing your online presence. Many smaller businesses would be lucky to get a few hours a week to dedicate to ORM, so we\u2019ve tailored our tips to that time constraint.<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are the six unspoken rules that make effective ORM possible for small businesses. For the sake of convenience, we\u2019ve listed them in the order that you should prioritize them if you\u2019re pressed for time. Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Rule #1: Monitor Reviews Regularly<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The cardinal rule of online reputation management is monitoring your online reviews on a regular basis. If you have the time, the ideal cadence would be to check in with reviews on a daily basis. If not, try not to go more than a few days without checking in\u2014definitely no longer than a week.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this so important? Online reviews are a key indicator of social proof for local businesses. Think about this in your own life: When was the last time you tried a new restaurant, workout studio or tailor shop without checking the reviews first?<\/p>\n<p>If your prospective customers are checking your reviews, you should be too. Which brings us to our next rule\u2026<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Rule #2: Engage with Positive <em>and<\/em> Negative Reviews<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Once you have a habit of checking your reviews regularly, it\u2019s time to take action. The key here is to respond to both positive and negative reviews whenever possible.<\/p>\n<p>For positive reviews, thank the person for their business and for taking the time to leave a review. If they left a longer account of their experience, find a small detail to mention in your response. This step helps with customer satisfaction by making your reviewer feel appreciated, <em>and<\/em> it gives the impression that you care about delivering a great experience. win-win.<\/p>\n<p>For negative reviews, your approach should depend on the content of the review. Check out the two sample responses below for inspiration. The first option works well if the person didn\u2019t share any details about what specifically went wrong\u2014like those pesky one-star reviews with no written comments. The second option works well if you do know the specifics of where you went wrong.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hi John, so sorry to hear that you were disappointed! We\u2019d love to hear more about what went wrong. Can you email us at [email] so we can make it right?<\/li>\n<li>Hi John, so sorry we let you down in [XYZ way]. We\u2019ve notified our team to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. Can you email us at [email] so we can get you a refund right away?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you happen to receive a negative review that you feel is unfair, say so in your response only if you can really back up your side of the issue. A response explaining the alternate perspective can help mitigate backlash from an uncharacteristically difficult customer. Just make sure you\u2019re truly innocent in the matter before you take this approach.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Rule #3: Take Action to Correct Common Complaints<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As you monitor reviews, keep an eye out for any complaints that are coming up frequently. A single bad review about a particular issue isn\u2019t a red flag, but multiple mentions likely indicate that you have a bigger problem on your hands.<\/p>\n<p>In these cases, take the time to speak with your customers and your team to understand the problem as clearly as possible. Then, put measures in place to correct the problem long-term. Follow up with your unhappy customers to let them know what you\u2019ve done to make things right, and make sure they feel good about the outcome.<\/p>\n<p>This process is a great way to stay on top of your company\u2019s image and to preserve the experience you\u2019re delivering to customers over time.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Rule #4: Have a Social Listening Plan<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Next, online reputation management isn\u2019t just about reviews\u2014it\u2019s also about your holistic online presence. To monitor what\u2019s being said about your company outside of reviews, have a social listening plan (or software tool) to keep track of your mentions. You may want to set up specific tracking measures for keywords like your company\u2019s name, your industry and even your founders\u2019 names.<\/p>\n<p>The same best practices about review management apply to your social listening plan. This expansion of your monitoring strategy just gives you more insight into what\u2019s being said about you across multiple channels.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Rule #5: Share User-Generated Content<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>User-generated content (UGC) is one of the best perks that comes from successful reputation management. By keeping track of what\u2019s being shared about your brand, you\u2019re likely to come across photos, videos and, of course, reviews that you can use to market your company to prospective customers.<\/p>\n<p>Happy customers are an incredible asset for your brand. They speak the same language as your target audience, and their recommendations will feel more authentic than your own endorsement. When you come across positive UGC online, ask for permission to use it to promote your business, then share away.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Rule #6: Have a Crisis Management Plan<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Lastly, if you have the luxury of time to plan online reputation management long-term, put some thought into your crisis management plan\u2014AKA what you\u2019ll do if something horrible happens to your online image. Think terrible press mentions, a slew of negative reviews or a similar disaster that could tank your business overnight.<\/p>\n<p>While you don\u2019t have to create a contingency plan for every possible outcome, thinking ahead can help you feel more in control if one of your worst-case scenarios ever happens. Hopefully, you will never have to use these plans, but you\u2019ll be glad you took this time if you do.<\/p>\n<h2>We\u2019re Here to Help<\/h2>\n<p>There you have it!
