You keep polishing it so that you have your best foot forward.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>&#8211; Matt Cutts<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s been a year since humanity came across one of its biggest foes to date.<\/p>\n<p>Back when Covid-19 struck our planet, government officials worldwide announced nationwide lockdowns and advised people to start practicing social distancing and stay inside their homes.<\/p>\n<p>Most industries were crushed; millions lost their jobs; hundreds of thousands of businesses had to shut down their operations permanently.<\/p>\n<p>For an entire year, people all across the world have been in a state of panic, confusion, uncertainty, and bewilderment.<\/p>\n<p>But now, with the first of the Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use across different countries, government officials have started easing off the restrictions.<\/p>\n<p>We are far from getting back to our old normal lives.<\/p>\n<p>Until then, it\u2019s important for businesses to weather this downturn and come up with and implement a foul-proof strategic marketing plan that will help them come out much stronger.<\/p>\n<p>With an ever-increasing number of consumers purchasing products and services online, especially after Covid-19 struck, more and more businesses and organizations (yes, that includes your competitors as well) are going through digital transformation to meet the needs and demands of their target audience.<\/p>\n<p>To stay a step ahead, it&#8217;s vital to focus on your SEO marketing efforts, which will help you rank at the top of the search engines for certain keywords and deliver an outstanding customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/goingclear.com\/googles-first-page-by-the-numbers\/#:~:text=The%20vast%20majority%20of%20people,page%20in%20their%20search%20results.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">90% of the consumers<\/a> don\u2019t move past the first page of the search engine results.<\/p>\n<p>This means if your website doesn\u2019t rank at the top, you\u2019ll be missing out on a majority of your prospects.<\/p>\n<p>To tackle this problem, marketers and businesses should focus on their SEO marketing efforts, which will not only help you boost your search engine rankings but also provide numerous benefits, which we will be looking at here.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s shift our focus towards the top reasons why SEO marketing is critical to a business&#8217; success, especially during the post-Covid-19 era.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5 Reasons Why Businesses Should Heavily Focus on SEO Marketing in the Post Covid-19 Era<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Following are the reasons why businesses should heavily focus on SEO marketing in the post-Covid-19 era:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shift Towards Digitalization<\/li>\n<li>Drive More Traffic Towards Your Website<\/li>\n<li>Increase Brand Awareness<\/li>\n<li>Attract Your Audience Towards Your Local Business<\/li>\n<li>Ensure Long-Term Growth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Shift Towards Digitalization<\/h3>\n<p>With more and more businesses paving a way towards their digital transformation and an ever-increasing number of consumers purchasing products and services online rather than visiting physical stores, now\u2019s the right time to start focusing on your SEO efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Moving forward, we will be seeing a gigantic rise in the number of people actively looking up for a business on search engines, purchasing products and services online, searching for a solution to their problems, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Also, we will see a massive surge in the number of Internet users in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>This makes it now more important than ever for businesses to focus on their SEO marketing. And if you don\u2019t, your website won\u2019t appear at the top of the SERPs, which means you won\u2019t be able to put yourself in front of your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine the number of your prospects you\u2019ll be missing out on.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, with the shift towards digitalization, it\u2019s important for businesses to focus on their SEO marketing now more than ever.<\/p>\n<h3>Drive More Traffic Towards Your Website<\/h3>\n<p>Obviously, you would love millions of people visiting your website each month, right?<\/p>\n<p>But, in the post-Covid-19 era, more and more businesses have been predicted to start focusing on their SEO efforts.<\/p>\n<p>And if you don\u2019t begin now, then you will be in direct competition with hundreds or thousands of your competitors later.<\/p>\n<p>So, to stay one step ahead and drive more traffic towards your website in the post-Covid-19 era, now&#8217;s the time to get your SEO journey rolling.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a long-term growth strategy and will yield sweet fruits within the next few months.<\/p>\n<h3>Increase Brand Awareness<\/h3>\n<p>Nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/branding-statistics\/#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">89% of marketers<\/a> claim brand awareness to be their top goal.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because 77% of the marketing leaders have admitted that a strong brand is vital and highly-critical to a business\u2019 growth, as it helps boost trust and increase revenue.<\/p>\n<p>In the Post Covid-19 era, consumers will be highly likely to trust and do business with a well-established brand rather than a business with almost no or weak online existence.<\/p>\n<p>Focusing on your SEO marketing will help you boost your search engine rankings, deliver outstanding customer experience, and build trust, which will result in a boost in brand awareness and drive more sales.<\/p>\n<h3>Attract Traffic Towards Your Local Business<\/h3>\n<p>I admit it. People are still scared of visiting physical stores, dining at their favorite restaurants, catching the latest movies in theatres.<\/p>\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of the physical stores.<\/p>\n<p>It never will be.<\/p>\n<p>Physical stores are as important as online businesses.<\/p>\n<p>But, in the post-Covid-19 era, consumers will most likely hop on to Google and get to know more about your local store before visiting in person.<\/p>\n<p>This makes it really important for businesses to focus on their Local SEO.<\/p>\n<h3>Ensure Long-Term Growth<\/h3>\n<p>I hate to say this, but <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2019\/05\/13\/50-of-businesses-fail-in-their-first-5-years-whats-the-secret-for-those-that-survive\/#:~:text=In%20the%20U.S.%2C%2020%20percent,fail%20in%20their%20tenth%20year.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">50% of the businesses fail<\/a> within the first five years.<\/p>\n<p>The reason? They don&#8217;t have a fool-proof game plan and a well-planned marketing strategy that ensures long-term growth.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve seen most business owners care more about their short-term goals, which is why most of them only focus on paid ads rather than SEO marketing.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not the way to go.<\/p>\n<p>To ensure long-term growth in the post-Covid-19 era, businesses should focus heavily on their organic efforts rather than singlehandedly relying on paid ads.<\/p>\n<h2>Boost Your SEO Marketing Efforts Now!<\/h2>\n<p>With Covid-19 finally coming to an end, businesses should start preparing themselves for the new world, if they haven\u2019t already.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/pay-per-result-seo\/\">Experts at Umbrella Local<\/a>, with 16+ years of hands-on SEO experience and extensive knowledge, would love nothing more than boosting your search engine rankings and helping you achieve your business goals.<\/p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for?<\/p>\n<p>Get Started TODAY!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To stay a step ahead, it&#8217;s vital to focus on your SEO marketing efforts, which will help you rank at the top of the search engines and deliver an outstanding customer experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":1287,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[72],"tags":[74,81],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1286"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/13"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1286"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1286\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1775,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1286\/revisions\/1775"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1287"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1286"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1286"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1286"},{"taxonomy":"table_tags","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/table_tags?post=1286"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
