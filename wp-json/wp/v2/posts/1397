Martin, D.C. and his massage machine (locally well known as \u201cGood Vibes\u201d) have been doing \u201crelationship counseling\u201d for patients and their troubled spines all over the Crescenta Valley. Patients have even traveled to Montrose, CA from adjacent valleys to regain optimum health and restore peak physical performance.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cWhat makes us different is the tremendous amount of physiotherapy work and personalized care we invest during the first year of treatment to ensure adjustments hold,\u201d Dr. Martin said. Additional services include deep tissue massage, micro-nutritional counseling and nutrition product support.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr. Martin is a native Iowan, born and raised. While he still follows the Hawkeyes (and the Chicago Bears, his father\u2019s favorite team), he\u2019s also a big fan of the Dodgers and Clippers, having spent nearly three decades in California.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-1398 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Stuart-Martin-DC.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Martin DC\" width=\"500\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Stuart-Martin-DC.jpg 500w, https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Stuart-Martin-DC-284x300.jpg 284w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr. Martin is what we like to call a Local Biz Hero, a self-made entrepreneur who brings true value to the Montrose community. High standards of professionalism and the strong work ethic of small business owners like Dr. Martin form the backbone of the Crescenta Valley and Montrose economy.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We sat down with Dr. Martin for a quick interview:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Q:\u00a0Why do you do what you do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A:\u00a0\u201cI actually started off my career in pre-med in undergrad studies, but realized I did not have a passion for traditional allopathic medicine. Towards the end of my medical training, when I had actually completed just about everything needed for chiropractic school, I had a back injury. Through chiropractic care, I experienced a tremendous healing and changed my career path as a result. For practical reasons it was a fantastic choice as I\u2019m also an actor, so I needed a good day job!\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Q:\u00a0How did you get into this profession?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A:\u00a0\u201cTruthfully, I credit it to a turning point in my life, which was getting introduced to transcendental meditation. Meditation started a whole new cascade of introductions and opportunities, including going to chiropractic school. I also became more interested in being of service to others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Q:\u00a0If you could share one tip with the readers for choosing a chiropractor, what would it be?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A: \u201cChoose a chiropractor that you feel genuinely cares for you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those of you who are looking for a professional chiropractor (and a better relationship with your spine and nervous system), Dr. Martin and his Good Vibes massaging machine should be your first choice.
