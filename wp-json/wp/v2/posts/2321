Simply put, email is an integral part of any business\u2019 digital marketing campaign. If you\u2019re wondering whether <a href=\"https:\/\/umbrellaxact.com\/service\/email-marketing\/\">email marketing services<\/a> are worth it, here are a few ways your business can build its brand through email marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>Create a Consistent Brand Voice<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to branding, consistency is key. Email marketing enables businesses like yours to establish their brand voice and drive engagement in a controlled environment: customer inboxes. Your brand voice should take into consideration your tone and your ideal customer persona.<\/p>\n<h3>Build Customer Personas<\/h3>\n<p>Your brand voice and tone are based on customer persona. Personas should include basic demographic information. This information is like the demographics by which you would segment your email marketing list. Typically, you want to have between two and four personas based on the specific demographics you want to engage.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, customer personas can be built from data your business has gathered from actual clients. In other words, you don&#8217;t have to create personas from scratch. Instead, look for commonalities between customers and identify trends. When combined, these trends come together to create your customer personas, and these personas can become the foundation for your brand\u2019s tone and voice.<\/p>\n<h3>Find Your Tone<\/h3>\n<p>Brand tone refers to the way your company communicates with its audience, your customers. As a general rule, your brand tone should be consistent across all channels from social media to paid ads and website copy. Email marketing is no exception and should mirror your brand\u2019s overall tone.<\/p>\n<p>If your brand hasn\u2019t set up a distinct tone, now is the time to find one. While there are unlimited iterations of what tone can mean for a specific brand, here are a few angles your brand can take:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Friendly<\/li>\n<li>Informative<\/li>\n<li>Casual<\/li>\n<li>Formal<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When figuring out the best tone for your brand\u2019s email and social media voice, consider the following: What are the top words you want to describe your business? The answer to this question is the foundation for your tone. Keep in mind that even similar words can have different connotations, though. The words, \u201cfriendly and educational,\u201d for example, are similar to but slightly different than \u201ckind and informative.\u201d By identifying the characteristics that you value most, you\u2019ve taken he first step to establishing your brand\u2019s tone.<\/p>\n<h2>Encourage Return Customers<\/h2>\n<p>Email marketing services aren&#8217;t only useful for getting new customers. In fact, email is a great way to generate brand loyalty and encourage customers to return to your business over and over again. One of the ways you can do this is through post-purchase email marketing. Post purchase emails are exactly what they sound like: messages designed to re-engage customers after they buy a product or service. What&#8217;s more, post-purchase emails don&#8217;t have to be a onetime strategy. In other words, you can reach out to customers intermittently after they buy from your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Generally speaking, the best method is to send these emails on a carefully planned schedule such as one week after purchase, one month after purchase, 90 days after purchase and so on. In short, post-purchase emails encourage return customers by keeping your brand top-of-mind. They\u2019re also a great way to encourage customer retention by highlighting new sales, new products, or items customers might need based on their prior interactions with your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Target the Right Audience at the Right Time<\/h2>\n<p>Email segmentation is a powerful tool to build your brand online. Whether you\u2019re doing email marketing yourself or working with an email marketing agency, there are two types of segmentation to which you should pay attention. The first one is demographics, and the second is warm versus cold customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Demographic Segmentation<\/h3>\n<p>Demographic segmentation enables businesses to target their ideal customer personas. For example, a luxury auto dealership may want to target individuals with an annual income of more than $80,000. An auto dealer specializing in SUVs, however, may want to target young married couples within a specific income bracket who also have at least one child or are interested in outdoor activities.<\/p>\n<h3>Warm and Cold Customers<\/h3>\n<p>On the one hand, segmenting your audience by warm and cold customers entails targeting your audience based on their level of engagement. Warm customers are those who typically open your emails, click on call-to-actions (CTAs) and exhibit behavior that shows interest in your brand.<\/p>\n<p>Cold customers are those who don\u2019t. You can build your brand through email marketing by specifically targeting \u201ccold\u201d customers with specials, new products and other incentives as opposed to spending unneeded resources getting engagement from warm customers who have already bought into your brand and are further down the conversion funnel.<\/p>\n<h2>Consistency and Branding Essentials<\/h2>\n<p>Some people think the term \u201cbranding\u201d refers to visual elements like logos and colors. But the reason these elements are important to branding is that they create consistency and remind customers what your business is about. Brand consistency goes far beyond your logo, and there are many ways your brand can reinforce itself with email marketing. Here are some of the most important things to pay attention to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logo<\/li>\n<li>Colors<\/li>\n<li>Fonts and font size<\/li>\n<li>Tone (in email copy and subject line)<\/li>\n<li>Email velocity (how often you connect with customers)<\/li>\n<li>Formatting (your email template)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Looking for an Email Marketing Agency?<\/h2>\n<p>Building a brand through email marketing is a tried and true method to improve your ROI and customer engagement.
