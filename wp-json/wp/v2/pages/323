It affects your rights.<\/p>\n<p>\u200bMost customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer\u2019s satisfaction by contacting us via our support center at https:\/\/umbrella.freshdesk.com . This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and UMBRELLA. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.<\/p>\n<p>Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and UMBRELLA shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and\/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney\u2019s fees).<\/p>\n<p>For the purpose of this Provision, \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d means UMBRELLA and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term \u201cDispute\u201d means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and THE COMPANY regarding any aspect of your relationship with THE COMPANY, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). \u201cDispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as THE COMPANY\u2019s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.<br \/>\nWE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give THE COMPANY an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to legal@umbrellaus.com . That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If THE COMPANY does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exclusions from Arbitration\/Right to Opt Out<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or THE COMPANY may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d). You may opt out of this Provision by sending a written notification to legal@umbrellaus.com. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with THE COMPANY through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with THE COMPANY. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Arbitration Procedures<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or THE COMPANY may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.<br \/>\nFor arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA\u2019s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.<br \/>\nBecause the Site, Services and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.<br \/>\nArbitration Award \u2013 The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.<br \/>\nLocation of Arbitration \u2013 You or THE COMPANY may initiate arbitration in either the State of New York or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, THE COMPANY may transfer the arbitration to New York in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.<br \/>\nPayment of Arbitration Fees and Costs \u2013 THE COMPANY will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator\u2019s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with THE COMPANY as provided in the section above titled \u201cPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\u201d and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Class Action Waiver<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and THE COMPANY specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Site or Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jury Waiver<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and THE COMPANY are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and THE COMPANY might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and\/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Severability<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Continuation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with UMBRELLA or its affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if UMBRELLA makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require UMBRELLA to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>General<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>UMBRELLA prefers to advise you if we feel you are not complying with these Terms and to recommend any necessary corrective action. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by UMBRELLA, may result in immediate termination of your access to the Site and\/or Services without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act, New York state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do not apply. The United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to this Agreement. Except for Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or this Site will be heard in the courts located in the city and State of New York. If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. UMBRELLAs\u2019s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and UMBRELLA and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and UMBRELLA about the Site and Services. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact Us<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions about these Terms or otherwise need to contact UMBRELLA for any reason, please contact via https:\/\/support.umbrellaus.com\/<\/p>\n<p>\u200b\u00a9 Umbrella Micro Franchises Inc.

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer\u2019s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site, in order to help us to process your online transactions and requests, verify your identity, track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and display advertising both on our Site and App and on third-party sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Clear GIFs<\/span>. Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs, in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors and App users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Third Party Analytics and Tracking<\/span>. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site and, to the extent permitted, our Application. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences, not to track users across our Site and third party sites. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Notice for Users<\/span>.

By using our online service, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Third-Party Ad Networks<\/span>. We may use third parties, such as network advertisers, to display advertisements on our Site, as well as to display ads on third-party websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad networks and related services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party\u2019s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our Services. We do not share your name, email address or other personal information with these third parties, and we do not permit these third parties to use cookies and other tracking technologies placed on our Site to automatically collect your personal information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What about Do-Not-Track options?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Currently, our Site does not honor browser requests not to be tracked.

For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org\/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info\/choices (DAA).<\/p>\n<p>Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you. It does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective.
